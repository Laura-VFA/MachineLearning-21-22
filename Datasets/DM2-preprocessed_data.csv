1;Camera;i buy this product because i need instant gratification i can not stand the torture of wait for my photo to come back from the lab and i do not want to pay extravagant sum for one hour develop the sonya mavra be the perfect solution for the click happy shutterbug who like to take lot of photo but doe not have an in home darkroom or an interest in the glance of traditional photography the great thing about the mavra be that you cannonade a photo and instantly see how it turn out on the build in color lead display if it suck take it again until you get it right non digital camera do not come close to offer this feature with film you take the photo and cross your finger if it be a one ti ame shoot forget it when you be use the sonya mavra you can not a variety of shoot with or without flash and look at the photo until you get what you want you cannonade black and white photo or add a quit septum quit effect that look like an old time photo that you get at the county fair a standard high density floppy disk be your quit film quit and hold about a ton of standard resolution photo great for internet use and half that amount of high resolution six that you can print out on your printer one criticism that i have hear about this product be that it doe not produce the glossy permanent print that you get when you use a film camera if you be will to spend some extra money you can get a decent inject printer for a few hundred buck that when use with special photo paper print photo that look a lot like traditional print if you go this route and be will to learn some software you will get permanent print that be superior to those that you get from the photo lab you can correct red eye and other common problem adjust contrast and color just a you would on your to and even remove your finger or the camera strap from the shoot you can print wallet and 8 quit x quit s to your heart s desire without pay for reprint the new magical can store a minute long peg movie complete with sound and like i say the photo lab people never see your photo start your own them webster ooh la la the fact that this camera us floppy disk pose a problem for some computer owner people with window base pu generally have floppy drive and can use the sonya mavra disk the i amass however do not come with a floppy drive you will have to she will out some extra buck for one if you want to use your mavra since i do not think you can connect u table like with some other digital camera if you would consider a mavra take note of the useful feature that you get with the high end model and be sure to get a decent printer and some photo quality paper to get the most out of your purchase br br

8;Camera;from polypus to today b i enjoy use an polypus d450z for about a year read my detail opinion on this product to know more but i eventually want a camera that would give easy access to manual function because the numerous step need to pas the automatic function of the d450z lead me to use it like a point and shoot most of the ti ame offer a direct u connection to download photo to my desktop and notebook be more sturdy the less the plastic the good translate accurate color my only d450z always have a blue tint be widely available so that an eventual repair would not leave me without a camera for month which wa unfortunately the case in my previous experience with polypus have access to high resolution such a 3 1 meg pipe wa not an incentive to change my camera but i eventually come to the conclusion that it sure would not hurt if i ever want to have some of my work print out after many price and feature comparison i choose the today dc4800 i wait to use it extensively before write about it here after two month of usage i think i be ready to share my think with you b a success in design and economics b the do 4800 s design be in my opinion a real achievement in economics all the accessible button be we will place on the cause so you would not constantly have to look at what you be do after just a few minute play with it your finger will do the work the cause feel very solid but the two plastic door for conductivity and the memory card look like they could break at any ti ame also the only button that i do not like be the power button you have to push it very hard and low probably to prevent unintended shutdown or low and i personally prefer when electronic material that react to a light touch you could pretty we will use this camera a a point and shoot if you would like to but a the widely use manual set have be put on the cause of the camera you will enjoy mentally override the automatic set and contrary to many point and shoot you would not constantly have to brow through a hierarchy of venus to set it up here be the function accessible mentally b self ti ame to choose the moment your camera will trigger it itself b burst mode to take 4 picture in sequence at the low picture quality you cannonade up to 16 b landscape to prevent the camera from rouse on a near subject and have the horizon in focus b close up to let the camera adjust the focus to take a subject between 0 7 2 3 foot in great detail b flash and flash set will let you choose between flash no flash red eye b exposure compensation from 2 to 2 this will let you choose to over or underexpose your subject to adapt to various light condition b aperture f 8 f 5 6 f 2 8 you can decide on the depth of field so that you can have sharpness and blurriness where you like it on your photo you can also choose p for the automatic set to take over b room in out you get a x physical room and also a x digital which add up to the x automatically when you press the room button long enough you could also choose to block your camera from enter the digital room mode to prevent yourself from use it i have yet to see a photo which benefit the use of the digital room they be always grain not only with the today s digital room but with all those i try i would have like to access the iso set and exposure mode mentally but these have be put on venus accessible on the lead also the optical viewfinder could be a little big b li unite memory for your memory b the today dc4800 come with a 16 mb compact flash memory card which be a complete nonsense for a 3 1 meg pipe camera at 3 1 up you will be able to fit 1 yes one compress picture on it if you compromise and add compression you will have 15 light compression or 32 high compression you could also choose to use le meg pipe then you would fit 21 2 2 28 1 6 and 47 0 8 needle to say that you will soon have to consider add another compact flash to your start kit i personally go for 48 mb on which i can fit 5 picture 3 1 compress meg pipe i rarely use it 48 3 1 light compression 63 2 2 85 1 6 and 143 0 8 vivid color and great detail b let me now get to the main point of interest picture quality today s digital picture be know for their vivid color and the dc4800 reaffirm this reputation the default color mode set be at saturate which contribute to the vivacity of the color if you prefer you can go for the normal mode or even shoot in black and white or septum you can also adjust the white balance mentally which will sure be very useful a i live in a country of snow i be in qu be i still have to expert agent with this function though because i some jam end up with a greenish tint on my photo when i overrule the default white balance set also the 3 1 meg pipe will give you incredibly crisis and sharp detail even if you use low compression but you will eventually lose it if you use a high compression mode which i do not recommend the most annoy problem i have so far with the dc4800 be it be inability to focus in low light condition it rarely focus on the subject i want to photograph but look for any source of light and focus at that point it get annoy to have sofa and table focus when people around be all flurry a for the flash it doe not wash the picture a much a my polypus do but still i do not like use it prefer to play with absent light battery down down and down again b my main complex not with the dc4800 go to the battery while a ni be rechargeable battery in my polypus d450z last for hour and hour of shoot with the do screen always turn on today s proprietary li ion battery that be use in the dc4800 doe not i empress me at all if i keep the lead on it doe not last more than 40 picture after which the lead turn it itself off i can keep shoot without it for a while but i do not like it at all first the optical viewfinder be too small second some of the main function such a the iso meet shutter speed and white balance be only accessible through the lead screen i suggest invest in an extra battery consider the kit that include a charge it be 10 more than buy the battery alone and it will charge your battery in 40 minute there be also the dc4800 expansion kit that will include the battery and charge plus a decent carry bag a clean lens pen and an inject sheet sample pack that be the one i choose and i be happy with it the charge be very portable and it will not be a problem to carry it around in your camera bag b a few word on accessory b b neck strap useful to prevent drop the camera but it be so i d prefer a wrist strap if you plan on use it be careful though that the lead may get scratch if you have hard button on your chest b lens cover it fall down pretty easily so you might want to consider fix it to the cause with a small cord b lithium ion battery this be a proprietary format which be apparently also use in some other band so if you go on a trip b ac adapt for in camera charge this take very long up to 4 hour i strongly recommend buy a kit include a fast charge and an extra battery b u cable perfect to transfer the picture to most recent computer mac or pu b video out cable for view picture on to never use it b today software it instal like a charm on my desktop computer but my sonya vain could not go through the whole installation i end up instal the driver mentally search for them on my desktop and copy them one by one on the vain painful operation but it now work perfectly on both computer when evaluation the cost of the dc4800 consider you will very soon what to buy these extra accessory b high capacity compact flash memory card consider at least 48 mb b expansion pack for the dc4800 item 1174770 100 you will get li ion battery li ion battery charge premium camera bag inject sample pack 5 4 x 6 sheet and a lens pen you could also go only for the battery 70 the battery and charge 80 a you can see for only 20 more you get quite a lot with the expansion pack which i recommend strongly you may eventually consider buy extra lens in which case you will also need to spend 25 on the sense adapt it come a a promotion with mine

10;Auto;general trooper information b the isuzu trooper ha be produce for over twenty year worldwide and be respect in many country for it 146s off road prowess and reliability sadly it hasn 146t receive such a warm welcome in the unite state and wa cancel in 2002 there 146s only one thing i blame for the downfall of the trooper and that would be the consumer report hack n slash job on the 1996 trooper their story wa the multi mate naderism and cause such a for that sale on the trooper fell abysmally after various strategics and incentive fail isuzu cancel the trooper in 2002 due to lack of sale volume the 1994 trooper i own be consider a rd generation model and it wa produce from 1992 until 1997 there we be several option package available from the basic trooper s up to the fully load le just a the a he content 82526768772 b ride a wa cross brand a the hand passport so the trooper wa mark a a acute six you 146ll find the same powertrain and most interior piece be the same between both model since the result value on both model be about the same you may want to look for an acute since they would have more badge and marginal scale interior the trooper be much easy to locate since they sell at a much fast rate than the six b my trooper experience b my trooper be a 1994 trooper s ve with the 5 speed manual transmission it ha only the standard option which make it quite load by 1994s standard it have ask mile when i purchase it and wa it very good condition i have since add an alarm system remote sexless entry custom wheel and tire and an upgrade sterno system

sun in good proportion a you can see the large hood offset the bulky body the only ugly part on a stock trooper be those hideous wheel i really wonder what some manufacturer be think when they specify wheel for a new model 147well gun we know people will never agree on what look great on our new sun so why don 146t we choose the most ugly wheel in our catalogue then they 146ll have to buy new ri a 148 isuzu should take notice of the wheel deep put on their grand cherokee and wrangle model subtle yet stylish the wheel on the trooper be wish inwards and look like an oversized pie pan only invert i choose to add m b color shock wheel in a 7 5 148 x 16 148 size these put my tire about 1 5 148 wide on each side and let me fit 245 75 16 into tear grapple tire without a lift and still have no rub the ri a and tire be obviously not necessary and we be purely personal preference i will say my trooper look much nice with it be new wheel b interior appearance comfort the inside of the trooper take a little while to get use to for one thing a 6 146 tall man will have 6 7 148 of room above his head when he visit down this sun doe have load of head room and a very generous amount of leg and knee room a we will this go for the back seat too and the rear seat be also wide enough to seat two adult for any length of ti ame in comfort for some reason the front seat be slightly firm and give you good support over long distance on a 1300 mile trip this fall the back seat passenger we be always ask to stop before the front seat a i say before it 146s not the room that be the problem but more the composition of the seat material the dash control be lay out in an fairly accessible manner and most function be easily readable without rouse on them too much the learn curve for the control can be steep for those of u use to american vehicle the main problem you might run into will involve the wipe and headlight control for some reason isuzu decide to put them both on the dash instead of the sneer column where god intend them to be after almost 10 000 mile of be the sole driver of my trooper i still turn off my headlight when i mean to turn off the paper it doesn 146t help that they be both exactly the same size and shape a less annoyance be the placement of the main cruise switch and the rear wipe switch they be place on either side of the sneer column on the dash and right behind the sneer wheel speak you have to feel around for them at night until you be familiar with their location now for the good point the 5 speed shift feel very smooth for a truck transmission one thing that seem so un important but which i 146ve really come to enjoy be the pull candle on all five door just slide your hand into the handle and pull out no thumb farm or button push require i also appreciate the light window switchgear it 146s a nice touch for those dark night ame drive standard power mirror be a nice feature on any base model sun but isuzu go the extra mile with heat and fold mirror the theater be selectable with a handy on off switch and those narrow garage door be easy to navigable when you push the mirror button and watch the mirror fold into the door power lock allow you lock or clock all five door from the driver 146s door and si amply the entry of multiple passenger fit and finish on the interior material be mid level at best but still acceptable for a mid wa sun the cloth be a very stain resistant material and much nice in cold weather than leather the interior of most trooper will be the dark gray theme of my truck and it 146s great for those too lazy to clean an and black both show the dirt much bad than gray so three cheer for monochromatic color scheme i really prefer the low end interior try be instead of the face wood and rabbit fur try be on the 147high end 148 be i 146m drive an i import sun thank you not my grandparent old 88 regency brougham since i don 146t have kiss of my own i can 146t comment on child seat installation but the rear door do open wide enough to comfortably stand in the open to position your kidney in their seat the 3 rd gen trooper be too old to be equip with the latch child seat system so you 146re stick with the old seatbelt rigmarole the rear seatbacks be adjustable which be a rare feature in this class of sum they decline far enough to get comfortable and rest to fold the seat down you only need pull the decline button and move the seatback forward this will bring the seatbacks to a level position but they most definitely don 146t fold into the floor you 146ll have to wrestle with the seat bolt and remove both rear seat for maxim alum cargo capacity this isn 146t a job you want to assign to your wife since both rear seat be heavy and bulky normally this isn 146t a problem since there be a large amount of storage behind the upright seat the rear door be of the 2 3 1 3 variety with the large leave door open first this be preferable to the 147dutch 148 door on suburban and gastro van usually i only need to open the leave door so access be easy with the large open there be a latch on the bottom that lock when the door be fully open which be useful on a hill or when it 146s windy outside b performance handle b the stock 3 2 late ve be adequate for everyday duty and be surprisingly duty up to 35 may the 188 fall of true be to thank for the trooper 146s low end grunt but 175 he isn 146t quite enough for this 4 300 lb truck to cruise comfortably on the freely the tramp acceleration speed be acceptable but nothing to write home about above 75 may the trooper 146s design element begin to work against it it be body shape give it a lot of cargo room for it be size but also endow it with the aerodynamics of a barn side wind buffet the trooper slightly more than other sum although it feel settle more than dangerous after drive my trooper at least 5 000 interstate mile i 146ve find it ride good with a medium load which be evidence of the truck base body on frame design i can say the trooper ride much nice than isuzu 146s a he content 82526768772 b ride a mostly due to the coil spring rear able coil spring generally give a more progressive suspension movement and a good more complaint ride this be definitely the case with the trooper and this help to keep the hideous pothole at bay on the freeze road of the midst rake have an excellent feel and stop predictable when need break distance seem to be average for an sun although 4 wheel anti lock wa only an option in 1994 handle be good than you would expect for a vehicle of the trooper 146s size and height while it doe have a large degree of body roll it will stick to a corner at much high speed than most will want to attempt sallow type maneuver be accomplish with moderate body sway and a little drivetrain shudder the emergency lane change wa where consumer report fail the trooper for roll over and this wa late prove to have be a base report other auto magazine attempt to retreat this situation and fail to achieve a follower while this be essentially a truck and it ha li agitation like all sum i don 146t consider the trooper any more prone to roll than any other sun of the mid wa one more thing the 1998 2002 model we be heavy and consequently have a high center of gravity so the early model aren 146t a top heavy a the new generation i would choose the 5 speed manual transmission over the automatic for this vehicle since the auto rob more power from the merely adequate engine it also doe not shift quickly or firmly and feel very sluggish in city traffic b what about the competition b the trooper 146s main competitor be the tooth runner deep cherokee ford explorer and chevrolet blaze the runner be admittedly a good vehicle both in fit finish and in quality the 3 ll six cylinder engine be comparable in both power and real world performance it 146s definitely small inside so both passenger and cargo space suffer it also cost up to twice a much use a a trooper you get what you pay for so for those on a budget the trooper be go to look good deep ha be work on it be cherokee model for almost 20 year so even in the mid wa it wa a we will sort out vehicle i 146ve have the pleasure of rid in several cherokee and these be my conclusion the cherokee be by nature a good off road vehicle and cannotackle incredibly difficult terrain in stock form it ha a good auto transmission and when equip with the 4 ll online six will perform very we will both on the highway and in the city where it fall behind everyone else in this class be interior refinement a 1994 cherokee still feel very much like a truck inside and ride like one too for a family that need and and a strong frame base vehicle the cherokee deserve a close look anyone that will see most of their mile on the highway should head towards a runner or trooper which be both good shalt sum i haven 146t own a mid wa ford explorer so i can 146t give you actual data for a comparison i do know some casual friend that have own them and reaction be mix while cheap to repair like most american make vehicle wa explorer will be have more than their share of breakdown by this ti ame and this be prove by their poor reliability score they also have a propensity to rust under the door and around the rear wheel i would personally recommend the explorer to someone the go blaze i army twin we be always popular in the northern state due to their relative low cost and the fact they we be available in and and several body configuration while they would carry a reliability history somewhat good than the explorer it 146s still a notch below deep and the i import many of the interior feature feel 147cheap 148 even on upper end sit model for some reason go can 146t seem to design a seat that be comfortable for long distance or include heat fold side mirror one point for isuzu the go twin strong point be definitely their 4 ll ve and transmission if you like speed and need to tow a reasonable size trailer take a close look at the blaze i army twin b trooper negative b it 146s not all rise for the trooper and there be some rather annoy issue that plague other isuzu model the geriatric 3 ll engine be actually source from go and be not what anyone would describe a a modern powerplant it ha a notorious valvetris notice problem that while not a true reliability problem it can be downright annoy another problem that ha plague both my a he content 82526768772 b ride a and trooper be poor quality lock cylinder these lock just win 146t work right and replacement be somewhat expensive you must resort to unlock other door and reach across the truck or get the cylinder replace since the trooper and the a he content 82526768772 b ride a share the same manual transmission it 146s no surprise they share the same part failure the slave cylinder for the clutch apparently fail at around 70 ask mile and slowly lead until your clutch win 146t disengage this be exactly the opposite of how a bad clutch feel when the slave cylinder fail you can 146t get your truck out of gear you can put a band aid on the problem by have someone 147bleed 148 your clutch line and get all the air out eventually you 146ll need to fix it for good though and it should cost between 250 350 to get it repair gas mileage be surprisingly bad for my trooper and i average 14 pg i wa get around 12 for most of the summer until i put my tire up to their max air pressure now i 146m get close to 17 with a few lip down to 13 or 14 this can 146t be consider good mileage by any mean and you wouldn 146t get the power of a ve that the mileage suggest you would i attribute most of this to the low hear and aforementioned barn like aerodynamics the last problem i must mention be the ti among belt noise if a trooper you own or one you be look at ha a loud lack or tap noise it could be the ti among belt pensioner this be a common problem with these engine around 100k mile and should be replace whenever you have your ti among belt replace the pensioner be a hydraulic happen spring that keep pressure on your ti among belt this remove any slack from the belt and prevent it from jump on the pulley the hydraulic portion fail after so many mile and cause the pensioner to cycle in and out rapidly this can sound just like an engine bear or rod slap but be significantly cheap to repair depend on labor cost you be look at 350 to 500 for ti among belt and pensioner replacement b final comment b even though the above negative may sound dance you must remember that every brand and model ha their own chronic defect and failure area the isuzu 146s be usually very reliable and if something fail it 146s usually a part that win 146t leave you strange if i have to do it all over again i would still buy my trooper even with it be little quire i have enjoy the storage and passenger capacity the trooper offer there be several useful isuzu form if you have question about your trooper although the isuzu dealer network be sorely lack i would not say the trooper be for everyone but i would give it a strong look along with the other sum i have mention the trooper pull ahead of it be competition in the area of value and cargo space check out the lunatic at the isuzu trooper owner guild if you want more into on trooper http www to com index html thank for read and feel free to comment b openroad

18;Auto;he un day hand die hi un day soon die 150 buy yourself an accent and you be let yourself in for a life ame of tongue twist action accord to my old next door neighbor who happen to own the brand back in it be gen park cheobol peri ame the correct pronunciation be 145hee un day 146 but then this be the same man who tell me that iso kettle we aren 146t alcoholic that the meat i wa eat wa duck and that the heart hotel wa due for desolation any day so who know what i can say be that hyundai have come a long way since their re badge cart leftover day and 1988 soul sponsorship i will never see another orange pony and not think flow to back then they we be the cheap transport you could i imagine to get you from a to b with a mind alum of fuss and comfort they we be 15 year ago what data be today minus the rover tie in and that wa fine organ price help organ car sell and unlike american car of the day they have the good sense not to explode when rear end these day they 146re still a cheap a christian aguillera after a few bailey but they 146re strive for two thing that the pop trumpet fundamentally fail to understand they 146re look for a medium of class and the respect that might go along with it hyundai want to be about more than price they want to be about more than value for inch most of their car be the big in their price range and they want to be about more than 10 year 100 000 mile warranty they want to be good car the nerve of these people of course anyone who want to make good car move to europe and hyundai be no exception which be where i have my first problem with the accent you see the european like their hatchback 150 and the accent wa design to be a watch add the trunk necessary to shift any unit in the u and suddenly you have something seriously ugly it doesn 146t help that the transformation wa do with the subtle of a michael jackson surgeon fully turn this be a car that doe not rest easy on the eye 150 not since the sedan version of the tooth echo have i see anything a ungainly and i 146ve see the paris hilton sex tape so the car fail the first test it be set 150 look awkward foreign and admit it kind cheap on the driveway the tiny 13 148 wheel don 146t help fail to fill the arch and shoe cinderella like in a shoe plastic i have an very odd video only version of cinderella okay coli be inside and thing get little good not only be it ugly but unlike a transsexual hooker it 146s poorly equip ask the price of a good brazilian female male operation by the way get you a car with little more than a weedy radio cassette player a clock and a much shiny gray plastic a you could ever want in defense of the car the dash be we will screw together and the radio be by sonya it 146s also a radio make for people who have small point compass rather than person size finger 150 the button tiny and virtually i impossible to pinpoint that 146s my only real complex not what control there be seem to be logical place and show no sign of break off in my hand a i tug at them start the car up and the 1 ll iv engine spark into life with a gruff but not unattractive note hyundai 146s have always have a bite of speak and the accent be no 98 lb heal 104hp and 106lbs of true be more than adequate in a car this size though to get to the maxim alum power you 146re go to have to rev a little hard than be comfortable it 146s not at all bad though a slightly mucous note give it a edge of shortness the 5 speed manual box be sweet than any i 146ve encounter from more too 150 le notch than you 146d i imagine and positive in the throw progress then be adequate if not swift and can be quite amuse if you 146re prepare to risk your eardrum and hold on for the red line you 146re not go to be heal and toy this one 150 but you feel a though you could both medal be we will weight and positive push hard on those rake and the nose will dive 150 that 146s to be expect i suppose a be the body roll on le than tight corner the skinny wheel give way a little early for my like but then i drive somewhat more aggressive than the people for whom this car wa intend and i 146m sure that under normal circumstance the whole thing be a decent balance of comfort and handle ability should it go wrong there be 4 airbags you can disable the passenger one should you be carry kiss but axis that 146s about it 150 active safety be useful i haven 146t see crash test rat but the car feel quite solid i 146d wager it would do okay where the car play it be ace of course be with that warranty 150 a basic 5 or 60 000 mile with roadside assistance to match 150 plus 10 year 100 000 mile on the drivetrain it 146s the most remarkable thing about a car this remarkable but then you get to think with no revolutionary technology no expensive bite and piece and a mind alum of wire this be a car that 146s be try and test over the year it 146s a si ample package yes but it 146s one that work serve cost be low a be cost of run insurance be peanut and 33mpg isn 146t at all bad which lead me to the horse for course part of the review the hyundai accent be no look and it 146s scarcely equip but it doe a job and it doe that job

26;Camera;the photo 780c be probably one of your best value in the megapixle camera market good quality picture for average use i e internet etc i have make a lot of money with the ability to show a good picture on the auction service thank to this little gem easy to use good economic feel and great software now for the bad point aside from the terrible battery life the distract green light in the viewfinder and the relatively large distance between viewfinder and lens my camera have an unusual problem the shutter release button lose it be quit click quit sound odd i know but it be a very i important feature of any camera to have a good mechanical support system for all of the function button or you risk the possibility of premature feature motivation in this case premature shutter release i call agra support and after an eternity on hold the girl wa very nice she walk me through test procedure and determine that the camera do in fact work and that she could not help me even though the camera be still in the warranty period i buy the unit on 2 7 2000 it be now 11 22 2000 i ask for the service or part department to see if i could resolve this matter myself her answer shock me quit we would not offer repair or part service sir quit what this mean be if your camera break after the warranty period throw it away and buy another one even if it be in the warranty period if it develop a problem that doe not directly affect the ability of the unit to take a picture i e prevent picture from be take or download to the computer you be out of luck this be like say if the spring on the trigger of your handful be break and you shoot yourself in the foot every ti ame you take the piece out of the bolster there be nothing the manufacturer will do for you because after all the gun doe fire bullet in all fairness though agra do agree to replace my camera after a lot of complain but let s face it the camera wa break if agra can work out all of the bag in this unit they could have one of the most popular camera on the market today i love the unit i just think company support could be good br br
27;Camera;first off i know precious little about photography if you be look to read about speck and the glance of digital photography read the review from people who know what they be talk about all i know be that this camera be unable easy to use and result in beautiful color print so if you like me just want to pick up a little camera and be able to successfully operate it then the powershot s230 be probably a wise choice the size be perfect small enough to fit into a purse or part pocket i ve haul this camera across country and barely know it be there the battery life be decent with pretty regular use i seldom need to charge it when it doe need judge up the charge doe not take but an hour or so without use the manual i wa able to figure out the general control battery port location and remove replace the memory card so this may be a bad sign for someone who be look for a camera load with feature it doe have an outdoor set and red eye reduction among other feature but basically i just turn it on point and shoot there be a small button on the back of the camera to select movie mode the playback screen or adjust the set to take regular picture i rarely use the movie mode a i d prefer to use my old ti ame y video movie camera for that sort of thing but it i have use it and the picture be decent i have a hard ti ame adjust to use it for the movie set a the camera be so tiny and it just felt strange for me to film that way after be use to lag around a five pound v home movie camera i prefer use it a a straight digital camera it be very si ample to ease a picture you would not want even though you will not be ease much a just about every photo capture be worth save when i grow more confident with my skill i plan to pursue the other set this camera ha to offer i do know that in the hand of a person far from be an expert i wa able to capture the moment and not miss a shoot on a recent trip to the oregon coast i wa tickle pink to see that the canon perfectly capture the turquoise of the water without miss a beat little old me wa actually able to take those postcard shoot and have some brag right when i get home remove the memory card be super si ample and it be a one step process to attach to my mac download wa a snap and i do not have to buy any extra software to view the photo on my desktop i realize this review be not too helpful to people look for thorough information but if you just want to start with an unfordable yet quality camera i can not see the canon let you wouldn in the hand of this idiot it do just what it should do it work beautifully
28;Camera;if you be look for a 3 megapixel camera which be what expert seem to be recommend a the mind alum for truly film quality i damage then strongly consider this model or the today dx3700 which be the cheap in this megapixel class the dx3700 ha few bell and whistle and cheap by about 100 so i agonize over pay extra for the dx3900 but i be extremely happy with it nonetheless the autofocus be the best i ve have on any point and shoot camera extremely accurate under all light condition weather your stand in the moon light or under a bright sun i find there be few waste shoot even with the luxury of be able to delete the bad one there seem to be only two meaningful difference between the camera 1 the dx3700 room be only digital i e electronic but the dx3900 room be both digital and optical so the physical lens also ha a room which seem to be more accurate and reliable in quality than digital room and 2 the dx3700 ha mb internal storage plus buy your own removable smart medium card which apparently be favor in japan europe while dx3900 ha no internal mb and buy your own removable compactflash card which be use more in u but price per megabyte mb storage be virtually the same approve 1 mb for either medium clearly if you have a li unite budget the dx3700 be the best bang for your buck since it produce the same quality of picture but with next cheap camera in the 3 megapixel class currently around 500 even the dx3900 remain a good deal if you want a good room and or this particular storage medium in practice i have find that the combination of the digital and optical room total x allow for great flexibility in picture take and i suspect the digital room alone on the dx3700 only x would have be le useful if you take personal photo for posterity this affect photo quality a much a the number of pipe and should be an i important consideration other plume the dx3900 be extremely lightweight but not fly amy which have worry me with memory of the old brown camera indeed it be small enough to carry in my shirt pocket it be also a sleek good look camera with a lens that automatically retract into a cover door to protect the lens when you turn the camera power on and off a useful feature for the careless like me do not bother with the proprietary lock station which be just a plastic tray for 70 the lock station be suppose to be one touch no trainer transfer of photo to your computer but it take just a much work to figure out the tray a to si amply connect the camera to your computer with a wire the storage of picture on the meg card that come with the camera it hold 7 pick at 3 1 megapixels 15 at 3 1 high compress 10 at 2 2 megapixels 13 pick at 1 6 megapixels and 23 at 8 megapixel shoot i plan on purchase the like cf128meg card a this be the best buy for the compact flash that i have see they could have make this camera at least 2 large and the lead viewer be also small download 25 50 picture seem to take a minute or le to my computer which i think be relatively miraculous the today software you use to view and manipulate the picture be easy to use today be the dinner or macdonald of the photo world and i think even my mon could figure it out best feature be the one that let you save in different format for e fail a real ti ame save when you want to share photo with others electronically also do not let anyone tell you that you need to replace the today haired battery that come with the camera with today one you can use other band of a battery although the manual say they need to be 1 2 vol i e rechargeable variety and not the standard 1 5 vol non rechargeable kind there be little reason not to be rechargeable anyway which be more cost effective in a few year you will no doubt be able to buy 4 or 5 megapixel camera for the same price but from what i ve read beyond 3 megapixels you can not really tell the difference except at huge enlargement size i e big than 8x11 and most snapshot be only x or maybe x so what would be the point so in sum this be a very good camera value if you would not want to let once in a life ame moment slip away while you wait for price on film quality 3 megapixel camera price to drop yet you would not want to spend what canon union and others be charge 500
29;Auto;if you put on ton of mile but want to look good do it this the car for you i be a mother of one and i have be drive my 1996 make 626 for a year it be sport unfordable and sensible it be a great purchase for the average income family our family could not afford 2 expensive vehicle so we give up our 1998 grand voyage for this car i have never regret it yet i feel safe be in a sedan vehicle and not a compact car our family budget could not afford a carry the make s back seat be spacious the handle of this vehicle be wonderful i live in the midst icy road be common and the car doe we will on all type of road the make 626 ha save me and my family hundred of dollar on gasoline the mileage of this vehicle range from 30 to 37 mile per gallon i can guarantee i will drive this vehicle into the grind i will get sick of it before it will quit history say so the make 626 look sick in black and i feel like a race ma in it

31;Camera;we have have our sonya mavra for a year and a half i have use a number of digital camera and we try out even more in the shop in tokyo before we buy it the best feature ha to be the disk drive no need to worry about run out of some expensive little memory stick just buy a new box of disk in fact we would run out of disk on our trip to the grand canyon but we figure we we be not far from somebody with a pp we manage to persuade the helicopter operator company to sell u a box of disk get home and i immediately stick the disk in and unload view the i damage the camera create a si ample html file a an index to the i damage so it be easy to flick through them at a friend house no worry they be bind to have a pp and of course it be get a floppy drive no problem show your last few day of pick to them i have a friend back in the up that actually take his pp on his ski trip with hi be just so that he can download picture from his digital camera no need with the mavra another great feature be the big screen on the back of the camera it continuously update when you be frame a shoot this doe not sound like much but it be so much easy to use than certain other camera which only update every second or so i be convince that the screen display be the reason that our four year old cannonade perfect picture with this camera it also mean that you would not have to have one eye on the scene and another on the screen the i damage quality be superb in good light we have find it doe not take the best night shoot there be a powerful flash but it can be a little overpower some jam if you be an sir buff move to digital you would definitely want to move up the mavra range from the fd81 however for any vacation family shoot or take pick for display on the web sell on bay etc i d recommend the fd81 the battery life be very good good still it always tell you how many minute you have get leave on vacation it usually last u a few day take photo and move every day br br

33;Auto;after drive all the mind van on the market read all the article surge the net for user comment like here and talk to real kit mechanic i buy the kit second ex all option for 21 500 the dealer even throw in 3 year of oil change i only have a couple hundred mile on the van but everything be perfect no battle no squeaky no problem it drive great and be very quiet on the road i will report any problem in the future a a service to those who be in the market for a midian i offer the follow to consider 1 there be really no question about the value of the second when compare it to the other minivan you would have to pay 7 000 to 10 000 extra to get a comparable mind van from hand tooth dodge 2 the only real question mark concern the quality and reliability of the second to address this issue kit offer the best warranty on the market to put my mind at ease i also talk to 3 different mechanic from 3 different dealer and they all say the same thing the second be the first vehicle kit ha produce that meet the japanese in term of initial quality and reliability the kit car be get good but still have room for i improvement in addition none of the mechanic saw any consistent repair problem yet two of the mechanic think that if there would be a problem it could be in the area of rake the fact the second weigh 500 800 pound more than other mind van may require more frequent replacement of the brake pad the other mechanic think that the kit engineer would have design beecher rake to accommodate the extra weight i guess only ti ame will tell foi for those of you who may be wonder about the hand odyssey magic third row seat that fold into the floor consider this your only option with the third row of seat be all or none what doe this mean in the real world we will my neighbor ha an odyssey and we we be go to travel with 5 people and lot luggage which require the removal of seat to accommodate the luggage the problem with the odyssey magic seat be if you make them disappear so doe seat for 3 people so you be leave with lot of room for luggage but seat for only 4 people of course you could remove 1 of the middle row chair for luggage storage but this be inconvenient placement of the luggage and 2 people have to sit in the le comfortable third row of seat with my second i just remove one of the third row seat and we we be ready to go a comfortable chair for each of the 5 adult and room for the luggage in the back where it belong if kit we be smart they would introduce a split magic seat on their next van
34;Camera;there be no question about it this camera will be a little bite of an investment however we be not photographer and we be please a punch with this camera picture quality be far superior to my 35 mm and the ease with which you cannotransfer picture to the computer make this a great choice the only drawback be that because it be so expensive we would not want to take it along on trip where it might get steal or break i ve take picture in the dark before just hop i wa ai among in the right direction and the picture turn out great the room be wonderful we have take picture about an acre away and the subject look like it be right in front of the camera with no degradation memory capacity be wonderful just get a memory card with the capacity that you need the flash work great in any light battery life be acceptable we just buy rechargeable battery so that we can have spare on hand the only problem that we have encounter be when we first get the camera we take a bunch of picture delete some that we would not want and then take some more late when we transfer the picture to the computer we wouldiscovered that the late picture though they exist on the camera could not be see by the computer customer support wa nonexistent they would not even call u back but we wouldiscovered that it wa because we would not reinitialize the memory card before take picture now whenever we wouldelete any picture we areinitialize the memory card before do anything else this mean that we need to transfer the exist photo onto the computer first so if you be go to be take a lot of picture at one ti ame it would be best to have a lot of memory card on hand but since we wouldiscovered this we have not have any problem
35;Camera;after write a review of the minimum this be my second one i sell my minimum last summer to buy a contact go probably will be my next review i want to go digital for a couple of year and find the quality so so and price fairly high anyhow i buy this louse 4 3 before christmas and i carry it everywhere small easy to use and it take great picture it be fun to use and you wouldownload the picture in your computer it be a different way to photograph kind of polaroid on steroid you can do an 80sec of video which be kind of fun i buy the louse i should say full revise because it be a full with louse dress it up and for those who know louse when they wouldress up they be pretty good at it at maxim alum definition you get 18 picture with the card and probably million at a low definition what be the use if definition be louse you can get card with more memory but if you have a computer you just have to download them and start again it take 2 battery a rechargable it doe not replace mmm for me because i like b w and i like to have print of 16 x 20 or 11 x 14 optic be ok but it be not so great for shoot architecture to me it add up to your regular photo equipment i compare the full to the louse the finish of the full be not a nice le memory cheap software but about 300 le be a digital camera it be not an investment in the sense of the regular my or all the other m s in a year or so a new one will come on the market with 6 or 8 million pipe and my toy will be obsolete but for the ti ame be it be a pretty cool camera with lot of feature that i probably will never use ti ame will tell what i like of this company i do not work for them or even in that business be that they come up with really cool tool on one end you will get the o louse which take you back to the 1920s and you have digital it seem that 30 of the company be now own by hero luxury brand i hope that they will not play too much with the line ostrich elephant skin gold stopwatch player go with your shoe point and shoot camera cool camera nice design easy to use expensive but they have a really nice log

43;Auto;one of the most dramatic change in the 2003 runner must be the highly evolve body contour at last the runner ha move beyond trucklike into a stylish multi purpose vehicle my last car wa a precede my 320 and through it i get to know every single technical in the dealer service department mainly because of numerous battle and part failure which require continuous visit back and forth to service i do not want to go through that again so i focus my attention on three we will rate vehicle the hand pilot and the tooth highland and 2003 runner i test drive all three and really like the highland and the pilot i initially felt the runner have a bulky feel to it but after i drive the sport model with the x read suspension my opinion change hand dealer will not negotiate the price of the pilot down by one penny and almost all option be extra and they quickly add up also the pilot be not available with a sun roof the highland drive superb and felt like a quality sedan the main drawback wa it wa a little on the tame side and have somewhat of a midian feel to it after i drive the 2003 runner 6 cy sport i know i have find my vehicle precede bend would be lucky if they could come up with an sun that drive this we will the sport suspension make a big difference in handle but that be just one component of a really nicely assemble package the interior space be very we will think out it be economically comfortable and ha the space early runner lack the fit and finish be really excellent the control and interior component look sharp the seat be mentally adjust but it doe not take long to find a comfortable position plus there be a power lumbar adjustment the factory sterno be outstanding this runner come equip with light vanity mirror which some model do not seem to have so far i have only drive only a few hundred mile but already i have drive through blind snow and rain a we will a deep freshly fall snow watch out this car will plow right through and not miss a beat at all ti jam it ha felt secure warm and comfortable bad weather performance shine i just wish i could have keep that new car clean appearance at least a few day before confront the winter element the icy gas mileage ha be decent an i important factor to consider with the price of gas rise daily
44;Camera;aiptek pocket can meg i have try out this camera on a sale or return basis and compare it with a cheap 0 imp camera and the full finepix2800 i wa consider it a a present in summary i would say that the aiptek be far superior to the 0 imp pocket camera a they be only just useful for small picture on web page the finepix 2800 however ha high quality picture in still mode excellent micro and close up feature a we will a a reasonably easy to use menu system so this new camera wa always go to be give a good run for it be money by comparison the aiptek ha only a poor close up facility so do not try to take picture of your prize flower a single head it be close view wa about cm when try to photograph document it just do not achieve the resolution to make an a or a document readable the full have no problem with anything down to the size of a large postage stamp one problem with the aiptek be the burn out when use the flash on fairly close range object the aiptek ha three resolution imp imp and imp when shoot a 30x25cm picture that fill the frame the aiptek produce only a mediocre quality picture even at imp with or without the flash the full do an excellent job despite work at only imp long and middle range view in good light we be fine the movie mode on the aiptek produce a clear i damage than the full with a true balance for artificial light although the aiptek us the fast compact flash card to store i damage the need to use this camera in the imp mode mean that it still take several second to make the camera available to shoot especially if use the flash a we will the aiptek menu system be very straightforward and should not take long to learn power be supply by 2 a alkaline battery that come with the camera the standard memory card be limb but i would always recommend at least limb the camera be quite a handy size and be the size of many mobile phone will fit into the pocket or sandbag the room lens be only x i soon miss the x optical room of my full also the room mode wa disable while use the movie mode and there be no sound with picture unlike the finepix the viewfinder be like to old compact camera i e it ha the same problem with parallel whilst this make it clear than the full s electronic version it doe make it hard to frame the picture accurately the viewfinder on the back be only slightly small than that of the full it be large enough and bright enough to operate effectively in most light condition it be a little hard in very bright sun but that be common to many other view panel on other camera overall i will return my review model and go back to my good old finepix 2800 this aiptek be easy to use and a handy size but doe not seem to be good value to me and the resolution be we will below what i would have expect for imp
45;Camera;with a family of 7 we spend a lot of money on photo develop i have be want a digital camera for quite some ti ame but have not find a decent one in my price range since i would have to buy a good photo printer to go along with it this camera wa quite an i impulse buy we we be browse through palmar and i saw this camera for sale with a today personal picture maker from remark in a package deal for 199 now i usually do not buy electronic equipment from palmar because i view their electronics department a very sub standard insert plug for best buy here upon get home with our new toy i i immediately start snap picture set up wa a breeze and this camera s feature be wonderful it be very easy to understand and use for the beginner but ha feature that an aid photographer would admire i quickly find that without a memory card you would not get very far with this camera i be able to store 6 picture in the best set on the internal mb memory of the camera this camera feature include 3 flash set auto flash full ti ame flash and no flash i almost always use no flash because the flash in this camera be extremely bright and wish out anything take in just about any light i actually take a picture of a friend in the pitch black of night with the flash on and it come out clear a day i do not think it need to be that bright other feature be a x room set i never use this feature because it be only available in the good set and i always take my picture in best it ha a review screen on the back that you can set to on or off and can also turn on the quickview feature that show you your picture i immediately after it be take if you use the review feature be prepare with a lot of battery on hand this camera come with software for unload and edit picture unload picture be very easy although very ti ame and battery consume for 6 picture i allow at least 10 minute for unload the photo edit software be great you can crop enhance make photo greet card although they only include christmas temple and print multiple picture on 1 sheet of paper this camera take amazingly clear and vivid picture a long a you have fresh battery a the battery age the capture ti ame prolong and you get some dizziness and slur if you would go ahead and buy this camera you will need to buy a memory card i find that an mb card be sufficient for normal use a lens cover and u a memory card reader to speed up the unload ti ame and save on battery life this camera alone detail for 119 at palmar although i have see it a high a 179 i recommend the package deal for maxim alum cost efficiency i plan to write a review on the printer separately
46;Auto;my friend own this car and we wouldrive to golf every week the course be in the hill lake cabot golf course and the road be really curly and windy and through these trip i ve come up with my own opinion of the 1995 scab 900 the first useful aspect of the 900 be the trunk space the trunk can fit both our golf bag have lot of room leftover there be also a fair amount of room in the back row of seat the head room be ample but the foot space be a little cramp the front passenger seat be very room with enough space to stretch your leg but i always have to sit in the back oh we will another thing i notice wa the acceleration on freely on camp the 900 struggle a little to get up to speed i would say it ha moderate acceleration sufficient but somewhat lack back to the curve road while turn on those i notice some body roll on the car it ha good handle but i think the stabilizer bar should be a little stiffen some people prone to car sickness might feel a bite queen while rid the the 900 but one very i important thing to note be that my friend s 900 ha be to the shop multiple ti jam he be even consider try to declare it a lemon so keep in mind that if you purchase the 1995 900 you might have to make multiple repair and fix up i think that the 1995 scab 900 be a good car overall it be one big problem be reliability over 2 visit to the shop per year be too much so if buy a use 900 make sure it ha a manufacturer use car warranty or something like that just to be safe br br
47;Camera;i buy this product to take photograph of item i wa sell on bay it wa the least expensive digital camera i could find at the ti ame and from read the box it seem like the resolution would be fine for my purpose but i have since learn that the quality be not nearly a good a you might think the store have one of the camera set up for customer to try but you can not actually see the photograph a they would appear on a computer you can only test feature and view the lead display and the picture on the display lead you to believe that the picture will be very high quality however when i get home and take some picture with the camera i find out the quality wa not nearly a good a i have expect certainly the quality wa possible and i have since discover way to make the picture look good for instance take picture outside without the flash but the quality just do not meet my expectation so if you be look for something with professional result a for business use you will definitely want to look at something else i also have a problem with the fact that it eat battery like crazy and it do not come with an adapt to allow it to plug in to the wall and you can not get an adapt for the camera locally it take a special adapt that you have to order from visitor and it be rather expensive overall this wa a decent purchase for the money though and i would recommend this for someone look for an expensive way to take picture of family and friend for use a personal picture br br
48;Camera;i ve own the sonya cybershot for for about 10 month and i still love it it ha some drawback but it work very we will it ha be extremely reliable unable and produce high quality i damage the peg movie feature be an add bonus but it be miss an optical room and u support this model be like the first in the cybershot series and the new duc six camera seem to address some of the problem with the for i originally get the for because it meet all of my the requirement of produce high resolution quality i damage a we will a short movie clip so i do not have to get a camcorder although i end up get one late anyway i intend the movie feature to be use to film the inside of home for my mon s real estate business but i do not find any software to edit the peg so it be be mostly a novelty and i ve use it on trip before we get the camcorder b it be great because b b high resolution quality photo the camera can record i damage in 1600x1200 pipe resolution with it be carl le lens the coloration ha be okay but not always perfect some jam it be ha more green and often there be not enough contrast so the i damage look di be and fade the i damage some jam come out a little flurry but when scale down it be not noticeable i ve order x inch print of the photo i ve take and they have come out fine from foot after make correction through photoshop 1600x1200 ha to be crop to fit a x print butterfly and photoaccess print have more contrast and green tilt which make the peg compression artifact more noticeable in solid area foot say 1600x1200 fix i damage be okay for 8x10 inch print here be a gallery of photo i ve take with the for http www king com album id 4294236267 b rechargeable battery the camera us sonya s infolithium battery which be rechargeable and the camera come with a recharger and an ac adapt i find charge the battery give it about an hour of use at least accord to the camera display it us le power when i put it on playback mode instead of record a we will a turn the lead backlight off an hour of usage may not seem like a lot but a couple picture here and a couple there end up last the whole day for me and only when i be also take picture at night do i start run low on power b lead display the horrid lead display supposedly us sunlight to illuminate the screen and this mean it make no difference whether the back light be on or off i can still see the display but it be kind of wash out and i can save battery power with the back light off b good size it be not too bulky like the mavra and it doe not have a protrude lens like the f505 it fit really snug in this leather bag i get with the camera which i recommend to anyone who get the camera i be not sure where you can get it but it ha a little pouch in the back perfect for hold extra memory stick b record peg move it can record peg move in 320x240 up to 15 second or 120x116 up to 60 second i use microsoft medium player to view the movie file but have not find a software to edit the frame or strip out audit b micro mode i like take close up photograph of object and the micro option on the camera let me do that without have to switch to a micro lens the only draw back be that it be easy to blur the i damage because of movement and hard to tell it be blur from the lead display it also ha a short field of focus so some jam other thing close or far away from the camera will be out of focus b wife lens the lens rotate back 180 degree and it be advertise a a way to take a picture or video of yourself while look at the lead but seriously this flexibility be one of the best feature of the camera i use it to take picture behind me of the sky or sunset when i be in a car and i be not drive of course if we be go the opposite direction or i be on the other side of the car i can stick it out the window and rotate the lens so i see the view in the lead the lens on the new f505 model wife too but it seem not on the duc six series b what could be i approve b b lack of optical room there be not an optical room only a digital room on this camera this ha be acceptable for the most part because i do not find the need to room in very often it be only when like i be try to photograph and amass that i wish there wa a room i would look into the other cybershot model if you need room option b picturegear like software the picturegear software that come with the camera be the like version it be pretty weak and the software basically only let the user download the i damage from the camera use the aerial connection use a photo edit software like photo deluge or photoshop if you want to manipulate the i damage if you own a sonya vain you may have the complete picturegear version which ha more option and supposedly let you stitch together i damage to create a panorama b aerial connection slow lack of u support use the aerial connection to download photo from the camera to the computer take a very long ti ame what be bad be that i can not really do anything else on the computer when it be download on top of that the picturegear software some jam clash i ve give up use the aerial method since i get a acacia card the card let me access the memory stick on a lawton a if it wa a regular drive then i hook up the lawton and my desktop computer on a network to get the file there be a memory stick floppy adapt but i have not try it neither the acacia card nor the floppy adapt come with the camera the for doe not have u support but the new model do some of the new sonya various have a memory stick slot on the side and that be one of the reason i get a vain for my mon when we have go on trip i only need to take the camera and lawton after shoot a day s worth of picture i above the file off of the camera to lawton b lack of non compress file format the camera only store still i damage a peg and doe not have the option to save in a non compress format such a stiff there be two option for the quality of the i damage standard and fine i always use the fine set because i usually end up far process the i damage through photo edit software like photoshop and the final picture ha to go through peg compression on top of the peg compression from the camera so i have to get the i damage from the camera in the best quality format possible b flash too strong the camera doe not offer the usual flash option like fill red eye etc it basically ha a high normal and low set which i think be all too strong and tend to wash out the i damage in low light situation i normally turn off the use of the flash because i find the exposure come out good but i have to be careful and hold the camera still or the picture blur i have read about put a piece of paper over the flash but i have not try that yet also some have report red eye problem with the flash b supply mb memory stick too small i can store about 8 10 still at the high quality and resolution and only about 3 4 video at 320x240 when i be travel i be able to get by with a limb memory stick for the whole day and even store about 20 30 picture and some video occasionally i run out of room and start use the mb memory stick b start up and record ti ame i do not know how we will the for compare to other digital camera in term of speed but there be a couple second delay when it start up after i turn it on and when it record i damage and move basically all digital camera i ve use have be like this and it get annoy when ti among be critical when you try the camera out in the store keep this in mind b lack of focus aperture film speed set the only option available be white balance indoor outdoor and exposure b purchase when i purchase this camera it wa about 899 retail and i get it at cry s for 799 plus a mb memory stick for about 39 i return the camera a week late because i find a sonya employee in the area sell his camera for 650 on bay i not only get the camera plus the accessory it normally come with battery recharger ac adapt aerial cable mb memory stick and software but a soft leather case a acacia card for lawton a limb memory stick and another mb memory stick which come with the acacia card the retail price for the camera ha drop since my purchase but my advice be to go to the electronics store to use and look at the camera then find the best deal by shop online and look at auction and store that do not require you to pay tax buy from a local store be still the best option for people that want to get it i immediately and like have the option to return or exchange it easily b conclusion some new model have come on the market in the u s since i get the for just from visit the sonya web site i see that they now have the duc s duc s duc s and duc f505 which address the u support stiff file format and room option the for be a great digital camera and i recommend it only because i ve be happy with the result but i will probably upgrade to a new model in the future because they be available here be a gallery of photo i ve take with the for http www

49;Camera;even though i see a few others have already write excellent review of this camera i be still excite about purchase mine and think i d chi ame in after do a considerable bite of price feature comparison for a digital camera in the 200 and under category i end up with the today cx4300 palmar cell them for 179 95 only 30 more than the price of the comparable 2 1 megapixel version for the money i think this camera cover all the i important base you get an lead screen to review your photo which you be not go to have on the sub 100 dig camera a a rule a glass lens instead of a low quality plastic one a build in flash with red eye reduction a key feature i be plus ability to use only fill flash also key a ti ame so you can get into your own photo the best resolution in it be class at imp and back by a company that be be do camera and film for a long ti ame compare to some other digital camera i ve use include a 700 or so sonya mavra i think this today doe an i impressive job of properly capture color and handle indoor light on the mavra i use i often have problem with indoor photo come out too dark and require some touch up in photoshop before they look really good a for color the cheap digital camera often do not capture dark shade of red burgundy maroon properly i have no such issue with this today on the downside though the camera doe have a few small flaw and fault my lens cap fit fine unlike one review apparently but i be not really thrill that it ha one in the first place their cheap 2 imp camera ha a build in lens cover that shutter over the lens whenever you switch off the power i d prefer that iso there be one le thing to lose or break i also run into the problem of the direction tongue button accidently think i push a direction when i wa try to push down the middle of it to confirm a menu choice some sort of true optical room would have be nice too i think i would have pay an extra 20 25 for that if it wa available i also agree with the review who complain that at 70 the optional easyshare dock be a market play how hard be to push a u cable into the side of the camera and have your pp auto detect it and start transfer photo the camera si amply doe not need a dock to make this operation easy the charge build in the dock be great but it should have come with the camera
50;Camera;with my best friend live on the other side of the country i get a little tire of constantly describe thing i have purchase or what size the hers i wa grow have get i decide that i would invest in a digital camera and send her picture instead believe me i wa not that great at describe thing and often leave my best friend say quit up i guess i can picture it quit now i just take a pick download it onto my computer and send it to her in a matter of minute i research and come across the polypus d 360l i wa attract to the relatively low price 299 and the high amount of megapixel for the price 1 3 i also like that it could be use on both an ism and mac have an lead screen wa very i important to me too the camera be very sleek look and be easy to carry there be an optional carry case that you can purchase the lead view window allow you to see the shoot i immediately so you can delete the one you would not like that way every shoot you keep be a good one it be also fun to take silly pick without worry that you will be waste space the camera ha a menu of function such a the quality of shoot you want date ti ame print drop a shoot shutter speed etc you can also adjust the flash for an indoor shoot overcast day or an outdoor shoot it also ha a sequence function where it will take several shoot right in a row it ha a ti ame also the quality of the picture be excellent several people have comment on how much detail the picture have and how crisp they be the camera come with a program that allow you to edit the picture on your computer the camera cannonade lot of shoot more if you use a low quality of shoot i ve never have a problem with it run out of space if you be on a long trip however you might want to download onto a computer more often i ve use the camera both indoors and outdoor and i ve never be disappoint in the camera s performance i have be disappoint in how i look in the pick but that be not the poor camera s fault ll one of the problem i have with the camera be the menu be a bite confuse without the manual also it us up battery pretty quickly 4 ana i purchase rechargeable battery which have solve the problem and have save a lot of money i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who be look for a moderately price digital camera that offer a lot of feature the camera be sleek and light and take wonderful picture your friend and family will love get such wonderful picture from you br br
51;Camera;i need a digital camera for my online business so my hobby who be the tache in the house start search camera he ha win some photography award and i wa will to defer to his judgement even though it seem that the one he pick out wa a bite complex for me we will i should have listen to the inner voice the polypus d 600l ha a lithium battery for the flash for regular operation it take 4 a battery actually i should say it eat them because they would not even last through one session there be power supply that will work and i do recommend that you get one because otherwise you will need to buy stock in duracell the camera be large and doe not come with a carry case a it be an expensive piece of equipment that to me be a serious flaw there be a build in flash and a room lens but only a x room so you can not get really close up from far away all of the operate button be easily accessible on the back and top but there be a lot of them and you really need to know what they mean the screen that show the picture you have just take reflect a fair amount of light so you really can not see it we will in the sun that be also where instruction and set appear for fix the brightness and detail of the picture and this can be a real problem on a nice day there be an instruction book but it be long and somewhat difficult because it be in three language on each page so you have to look for the one you understand best it would have be good to just put them in section of english french and spanish the polypus d 600l doe not self adjust at all if you would not get the set just right the color be way off since i sell clothe this be a major problem for display my product overall i be not thrill with this product it will take nice picture but so will some of the si ample digital perhaps for an expert it be a superior camera but for someone with mind anal experience it be a maxim anal his not use br br
52;Camera;i have a sonya mavra fd83 that i have be very please with in term of decent shoot decent color however it be very bulky to take and it end up stay at home in addition on a vacation deal with fifty flop be dance to say the least so i want a small take anywhere camera that i could take on vacation i settle on the union coolpix 885 because of union s reputation and because of a few positive online review of the camera the camera be we will make and fairly easy to use what the problem be and this be something that i could have know have i read review on the digital web site be that it have a markedly red coloration to picture especially indoors this wa notice not only by myself an aid amateur photographer but also by my wife and my mon both who be point and shutter it wa so bad that i return the camera for a loss and have to sell again at a big loss the rechargeable battery and charge that i buy for it while we be on the subject i think it be horrible market to sell the camera without the recharger and rechargeable battery this be a 120 dollar hide cost because no one in their right mind be go to buy expensive throwaway battery for their camera union s customer service wa about a unconcerned a they could be in spite of many user comment and complex not about this problem they wouldenied it completely the technical person say that he think this problem might be fix in the next firmware upgrade but have no information since those technician be in japan and do not communicate what they be work on to the u technical staff a a result of this i will never ever purchase a union product again i go out and do some more research and end up with a canon powershot s110 which cost 330 dollar i could not be happy with this tiny gem of a camera and i take it everywhere

56;Auto;the vulvo xc90 ha like all vols a truly horrible name it baffle me that people a nice a the swede 150 forward look neutral anna inhibit high live socialist that they be 150 couldn 146t come up with something more friendly than xc90 i know that it 146s probably code for enormous vulvo sun that look like a great big car rather than a box on wheel and go like stink but i don 146t like it it 146s just not blonde enough vols should be call thing like even or agent but enough of my insane ramble and into the review proper the vulvo xc90 be of course about a swedish a bruce springstein conceive in america for america road american wallet and american sensibility it be in fact a post ford no doubt the swede we be don into sell to the blue oval a misunderstand involve a cell phone with poor reception a ford 2 his outside of stockholm and a half gallon of inexplicable expensive vodka but sell they we be and since then the pressure ha be on to produce an sun of course the sun should have be a vulvo concept forever the master of the utilitarian over the sex the safe over the breath take and the room remember those huge wagon over the sensible how many people really shift furniture that often vulvo should have clean up in what the up call the 145grass 145n 146 gravel 146 market 150 allow it be owner to stamp across verse and up long driveway with not a who amber of complex not ala the vulvo bank account resemble that of mike son and so the never get around to develop the car that could define them until ford come along dip deep into debt and provide a much need injection of cash a totally free hand of course wa not grant 150 vulvo be now a much a part of the re engineer platform world a any manufacturer and thus the xc90 sit on a platform develop for the s vulvo i amaginatively call this platform the e 150 oh to be in their 145namestorms 146 hut what this doe be give the xc90 very car like proportion or at least it look a though it ha car like proportion it be in fact much big than it look much much big i imagine bump in to early column and realize that he could have a shoot at the na a shock right not a much of a shock a the vulvo 146s proportion whilst it share length and width with the s it 146s a full 14 inch tall a riot of bedroom of course what those extra inch give be the appearance of grind clearance and that high drive position that invoke in u all a feel of i amperiousness so let 146s start by walk around the car it look like we will it look like a great big vulvo it 146s very shabby very angular and ha that swedish aversion to curve that ha be the marque 146s signature from the rear the tail light absolutely dominate erupt into huge pillar that seem to make up the entire rear pillar and threaten a begin like explosion of light should you set foot on break there 146s lot of matt black plastic a 145skirting 146 150 no doubt in a bid to establish 145off road credential 146 150 clean they look a little tack but get some mud splash go and they seem to blend in to the overall design we will the rear spill 70 30 but seem a little high necessitate a bend of the knee a you load up the grocery inside thing be a step up from the usual vulvo blindness there 146s lot of light color add to airiness there 146s wood that look like wood and face aluminium that look like arm face aluminium the overall effect be please and the car feel build to last dash layout be si ample to the point of insult but again feel very vulvo with only four thing speed distance temperature and fuel level outline i find the drive position to be excellent if a little bus like my wife have more problem say that the high wheel and upright position make her feel like a kid behind the wheel of her dad 146s car she 146s 5 146 4 148 i think she also have problem with the thick pillar restrict vision something i 146ve read about but didn 146t experience myself seat be great a you 146d expect with the leather add a real vulvo smell to the mix lumbar support be adjustable and excellent a be the whiplash control there be lot of seat too three row of them do all manner of clever trick fold in numerous way and demand a degree in apply algebra to quantity their cleverness you can even make one row disappear entirely the back row be le than room not ideal for small kiss too far away to reach and therefore design exclusively a far a i cannotell for those annoy 8 10 year old who want to play 145rip the arm off expensive future collectable 146 still the lay out be fine and dandy and everything feel too we will make for a car that be multi lately go to be thrash by the carry of kiss dog and elderly relative 146s furniture start her up and thing get even sweet vulvo may be know for it be 5 cy engine but the 2 ll 6 cy engine be just a sweet 280lbs of true below 2 000 rum be good for initial shut or pull that trailer and with 268 the there 146s plenty of power too the automatic gearbox doe a good job of keep forward momentum 150 yes there 146s a little turn law and you 146re not go to lose many people from he light but the car pull and keep pull all the way to the realize all wheel be drive give safe but remarkable response you know what the vulvo be go to do 150 it 146s safe it 146s remarkable not overlay involve 150 very swedish quite detach and a little cold perhaps but responsive the car be a pretty relax place to be 150 you want along a little too upright but feel quite unnoticed at speed slightly fast than you 146d i imagine we wouldn 146t take the car off road but have hear that it come okay and that 146s good enough 150 you wouldn 146t buy something this autocratic to get it dirty down on the farm head quickly into a corner and you 146re go to feel your lunch rise in your throat 150 this isn 146t a taut car by any measure but one 150 that measure be other sum and against those it more than hold it be own safety of course be a vulvo advantage though result beat them and this car be no exception here be some of the unique safety feature take from the webster assume that every other safety feature be include 150 you 146ll be right 149 roll stability control ft gyrosocopic snore it win 146t roll over then 149 full length 145curtain 146 airbags protect every seat 149 all seat seatbelt pre pensioner 149 low cross member 150 save you from 145mounting 146 other car in case of accident 149 pedestrian crumple bone 150 save people when you now them down 149 whiplash protection 150 the front seat move back in case of i impact save you whiplash pretty safe then the vulvo be swedish in the way it 146s equip however 150 this car be stack like a rheumatic blonde 150 with front and rear control for the coli mate control electric driver 146s seat cruise nice leather real wood and a d player good enough to have in your study so what do we think about the vulvo we will like roxette another fine swedish export it wa we will put together very professional and perhaps a little too polish i like to drive to feel a car move fluid with me and the vulvo didn 146t really allow me to do that 150 allow through bend when push and quietly let you know that this kind of behavior really isn 146t on and the look be a bite of a turn off too it look exactly a you 146d expect and american vulvo to look 150 supersede ala it 146s a look that just doesn 146t come off of course the vulvo wasn 146t make for me it wa make for people with child and dog and all the stuff that come with child and dog it wa design to deal with the baggage physical and emotional the desperate need for safety above all and the even more desperate need for a little space that have kiss bring that and to look suitably expensive not to mention expensive on the lawn with that in mind this car be a complete success now where do i put those condemn
57;Auto;i be write this opinion because i feel i be fairly educate in regard to deep granger be that i have own two myself my first deep wa a rebuild 1979 c 7 this wa a great second car but by no mean a reliable car to drive everyday i use this car for entertainment purpose only due to the fact that it wa an extremely bump ride not comfortable for long period of ti ame drive and very loud the car i specifically write about be my last previous car which i drive for two year this wa a 1997 deep wrangle sport x if you be interest in purchase this car there be many pro and son that i feel you should know about i guess a few year after sell my 79 deep i begin to think that i really want a new model so i begin my research pro it be no doubt a quit fun quit vehicle i live in a major city so most of my drive ti ame wa city mile many day of the summer spend with the top down and be no doubt an eye catcher for many people at night it wa wonderful to drive with the top down i have a 6 cylinder which come in handy in pull my jet skin but my sister ha a 1999 deep wrangle 4 cylinder and it handle the load with no difficulty either i often for more power which drive on the highway in dallas be almost a necessity to get on the highway more power fast speed in le ti ame son if you be interest in a deep please consider out for the extend warranty i buy my 1997 deep in the first of 1998 with little mile i purchase the extend warranty which come in handy my factory warranty end at 36 000 mile and it 40 000 mile the top form a tear in the seat extend from the windshield all the way to the back of the top of the deep at 60 000 mile my differential able dust which wa a shop 2 000 at the leadership that wa cover by the extend warranty all the while the furnish a rental car for me to drive fortunately the wheel base in the model be wide than previous year so i felt comfortable drive at speed of 70 80 mile without worry about slip but the wind noise on the soft top wa uncomfortable and extremely loud no doubt over ti ame you will get use to this noise or you will end up sell because of it you either like it or hate it i grow to like it because i upgrade my sterno system to drown out some of the noise another con be the soft top this be no doubt a welcome invite for thief to enter your car over a two and a half year span i have my car break into 4 ti jam 3 of which the thief enter my car by splash the plastic window this be also a haste if you would not have a garage for me i do not have a garage this also mean that every ti ame i want to take my top off which alone be a strenuous process that cannonade up 20 minute i have to also put it back on at the end of the day it be inevitable that your plastic window over ti ame will become somewhat of a foggy or le transparent look mine in case we be scratch very easily another issue to address be space i forget how much of a packet i be and how much stuff i actually leg around this be not the vehicle for you if you be the same i could never go anywhere and leave anything at all in my car for fear of it be steal every ti ame i remember this it wa always too late i wa already where i need to be and totally forget and would end up lag around a big ruffle bag at the mall for example most people would probably remember these thing but again i be not like most people so i be touch on this topic for a foi for some who it would also apply to overall i would say this car would be perfect for someone in their ten to midtwenties i be 26 and after have the luxury of a car begin to miss those luxury after drive a deep i would love to own another one but not a my peri mary mean of transportation revise 6 26 00 a per request on a comment i ll give a little more helpful into a i say before my sister ha a deep practically identical to mine one major difference be the seat i often for the final seat which wa a big mistake in the summer ame it get extremely hot and very easy to sweat my sister have cloth interior which wa extremely comfortable the final seat also with ti ame develop crack which should not have happen because i always keep them clean and clean them with the recommend solution the seat we be pretty comfortable in regard to adjustment but the material in the final make them uncomfortable in regard to how it candle i put 30 quit tire on my deep so it handle relatively we will the only ti ame s it somewhat scar me wa when i unexpectedly take a corner and find out the street wa a have wet and i do a complete 180 that take me for a little loop over the course of own my deep i do this several ti jam but it handle really we will
58;Camera;background i do not own this camera but a friend of mine get it for christmas and i spend some ti ame play with it and here be my think on it b camera aesthetic the camera it itself look pretty cool it be small size allow it to be place easily into most part coat pocket one of the thing i notice right off the bat wa in place of a manual lens cover there be an automatic protective barrier instead which open and close when you turn the camera on or off that be pretty handy to me because on my polypus c4040 which be a large camera the lens cap tend to be somewhat of a pain if it be windy outside and you be try to take picture it blow around and may even hit the camera a the cap dangle from it be cord speak of power on that be something i do not like about the sonya you have to turn power on and then select your shoot mode on the polypus you si amply turn the dial and it come on ready to go no extra step the 1 5 lead ha a surprisingly high resolution when review picture i wa amaze at how clear and crisp the i damage we be menu navigation wa fairly intuition but since i do not have the manual some of the symbol we be a little cystic and i could not figure out what they we be if you have have previous experience with digital camera or photography you should not have any problem with this camera picture quality the various i damage resolution to choose from be show below for the include 32 mb memory stick memory fine standard 2592x1944 imp 12 23 2592x1728 3 2 12 23 2048x1536 imp 20 37 1280x960 imp 50 93 640x480 va 196 491 the i damage we we be shoot with the camera we be mostly at the 2048x1536 standard resolution at imp the color detail at this level wa very i impressive we we be inside a restaurant with other friend at the ti ame and all the picture come out look amaze we be they a good a one shoot with my imp polypus i do not know but if i have to guess the color detail wa good with the sonya than i would have get shoot with my camera some pg ve video wa shoot and now i wa really i impress with the quality of video take in the low light restaurant situation it wa not grain at all and the frame rate and audit son we be excellent i think the file end up be almost mb for about 20 second i would not suggest use the camera a a camcorder though but it be good to know that it doe have this ability should the need ever arise b thing to consider battery this particular sonya model us a proprietary sonya battery model no fc11 i personally find this a somewhat of a big negative on the camera from a casual user standpoint for the follow reason 1 to buy an additional rechargeable battery be 49 95 everyone need at least one additional if not two additional battery if you travel and be out away from your hotel room or ship room and your battery dy during your excursion down in the ileum calder on the big island of hawaii then what be you go to do you see my point you should always carry multiple battery 2 along the obvious same line a 1 it doe not use standard a battery which can be buy from just about anywhere at anti ame true story example last year i wa at a professional woman s belliard tournament in tunica m a lot of famous people we be there and i wa take picture like there wa no tomorrow both of the famous people and me with the famous people towards the end of the day i have completely exhaust my original set and back set of battery but there wa still more to do so be about 30 minute from our hotel room i just go to the hotel store and pick up a pack of a battery pop em in and shoot the rest of the night if i would have have a can that use special battery i would have be screw so that be my main hang up on battery and digital camera get a card reader i highly recommend get the card reader accessory from sand it be cheap 20 and allow for some major convenience when transfer pick to your computer if you use window up it be a plug and play device i borrow my friend come in hook it up to the u port on my peter and transfer the file off the memory stick with no problem the computer treat the memory reader a a separate disk drive new carry case that be up to you i do not have one but my friend buy one for the sonya i personally think in most situation they can be more trouble than they be worth especially if you be travel but it depend on your travel situation extend warranty these day technology advance at such a rapid pace in 12 month the camera will only be worth a fraction of what you pay for it it be for this reason i do not recommend the purchase of extend warranty on electronic item by the ti ame the standard warranty ha expire 99 ti jam out of 100 you be good of run it and buy something new and good many ti jam for le than what pay for what you be throw away b conclusion the camera be pretty expensive retail for 450 so it may be out of some people s price range however it be small size and high quality i damage make it a pretty good contend if those thing be i important to you

60;Camera;be only the second digital camera i have ever use i be go to say that hp315 be a pretty nice little camera it be best make for whoever want to take some nice quality picture and be will to take a step forward with the technology it be relatively small small than the sir model and be not heavy at all the photo quality be great much good other si similar camera that be in the same price range it ha 2 1 megapixels and you can choose if you want to shoot in regular fine or supervise mode naturally supervise require more memory on the 8 mb card only allow you to take a total of 10 supervise photo before you wouldownload them onto your computer in regular mode you cannonade up to 50 there be a 1 8 inch color screen on the back of the camera allow you to view and select photo for deletion or download to take picture you can either just look through the viewfinder or turn on the lead and look through that use the lead doe however oris note battery rather quickly so i try to avoid it unless i want to view already take picture the hp315 doe have a 2 5 digital room however to take picture use the room be a bite difficult you have to turn on the lead to do this drain battery however it doe help to produce beautiful shoot overall i would say that this be a great little camera it ha a nice weight be easy to operate and ha handy little rubber grip on it iso that you would not drop it if you have the money you should look into it br br

62;Auto;we like to keep our car quite a long ti ame which be not hard since they have be volkswagens and during the last couple of year we have them we go and test drive everything that appeal to u at all so that we be educate when we would finally purchase we be not blandly loyal to ve but they just seem to have the most car for the money most of the ti ame the 98 ve pass wa design for that year and it wa just so refreshingly new we like it from the first test drive it felt heavy than the jest and golf that we we be use to and it ha the 15 wheel which mean a smooth ride than the 14 or small wheel this wa the first car this large that we would be buy there be so much leg room and head room and the seat be the most comfortable that ve ha offer once we wouldrove the pass we we be sell we buy the 4 cylinder standard transmission model with the heat leather seat we have never have heat seat and i have think boy what a i ammick we will unless the weather be quite warm those heat seat be just great even of a moderately cool day it feel good to get in and warm up the seat even if we turn them off soon this item just make a world of difference in the comfort level and people who have ride with u have be very i impress our pass be a light aquamarine call elegant green and it doe turn head it be a beautiful soft shade i also rate the back seat favorably it be room and comfortable with the head room and leg room for adult to ride in back and we have have a number of people say that it be the most comfortable and room back seat they have ever be in i think many manufacturer look at the back seat a where the kiss and maybe the dog ride so how nice doe it have to be volkswagen make every seat in the pass comfortable for adult unlike it seem most people i do not car for a sun roof or moon roof so i can not comment on ve s since our pass doe not have one we have have very little trouble with this car in fact i do not recall any repair we just get the regular his notenance we would have the front rake refine which surprise u a little since we normally go a long ti ame between brake job but then this car be heavy than our previous one nothing ha actually break on the car reliability be the most i important thing to u and i think we get this with the pass the main negative for me be the air condition we live in the west virginia northern panhandle where we certainly do not have the kind of hot weather they get in mimi or phoenix but i find the air condition to be just adequate i do not want the inside of the car to be frigid anyway and with only moderately hot summer weather the air condition be ok it be adequate it just seem such a shame to me that they could build this wonderful car with the post seat and beautiful say and then put in an air condition that be just not in the same league with the rest of the car surely the one they put on the market to sell in the south have different and good system in them this a c be just rather disappoint like a couple of other poster here i would like more cup holder and maybe in metal rather than plastic in the front where we use them a lot i would recommend this car to anyone who want a smooth ride with ease of handle in a car who be watchword be reliability i would not recommend it to people who want really frigid air condition for those buy in hot coli mate i would say take it for a long ride in the heat of the day and test that a c out before you buy
63;Auto;i be rent dodge status because one of our vehicle be in the shop i have to say that i be completely tear on whether or not i like it the e that i be drive doe have a very sport appearance and i like the white gauge the only thing i do not like about the outside appearance be the hubcap they look terrible i have not do a lot of homework on this car so i do not know whether or not the car even come with aluminium wheel or what the wheel look like if they would inside the car i do not feel like it be really that comfortable i absolutely hate the tilt wheel mechanism i think it be cheap and a his note seat be very weird feel i do not know what to think of them really they have good low and upper back support but somewhere in the middle there be not any what be that about the bedroom be very tight i be 6 0 quit and do not have many problem with car but the status be small i commune 120 mile a day and i be really not comfortable i ve be in bad car my wife s old go storm but not many it be pretty cramp i do not like the control for the sterno because they be little hard to reach especially when you have to keep your eye on the road you have to erect the tape in order to listen to the radio and learn how to set the present for for take awhile to figure out the dome light turn off when you shut the door not when you turn the key the trunk look like it be pretty big the door open nice and wide but you have to do all the work if you pop the trunk from inside the only thing that happen be the latch release you have to reach up over the expanse of the trunk open to open and close it i wa be a little lazy today and only open the trunk halfway what result be that my wife end up smack her head on the door also the button to release the rear seat back be a little out of the way you have to stretch across to the middle in order to get this to work come on day adler chrysler be it too much to ask for two button i mean this car be above ask spend a little the actual drive experience of the car be pretty good it be get plenty of power the only thing i do not like about this be that whenever i set the cruise control the car tend to want to jump up a couple mile per hour i ll set it for 65 and the car will cruise at 67 or 68 it seem to be a little high his notenance also to cancel the cruise control you have to practically slam on the rake most car you just lightly tap but not the status i know that it ha a cancel button on the sneer wheel but who remember that i have drive no other car by any other manufacturer that ha that feature i usually end up try to turn cruise on use that button anyway i be not at all i impress with the air condition it take forever to cool the car down our dog grip be the great dane ride to and from work with u and he ha do nothing but part to and from work our car ha a couple event in the back seat but even so it take a lot to cool that car down a far a my overall i impression of the car i be tear there be thing i like on it but there be enough that i do not like that i would not buy one the car be ok not something you cruise town in and say quit hey look at what i just buy quit people could care le to get this car to look cool would take new wheel and tire preferably low profile and tint this probably would not look good on the maroon one i be drive though br br
64;Camera;i ve always think that digital camera we be one of the most i important 147killer ape 148 of the technological age but it ha take until now for the technology to advance enough and produce a product that ha the quality and feature to truly replace your typical mmm point and shoot camera the d510 room from polypus be a perfect example of such a product now i ll be honest i do not do a whole lot of research before buy my new toy i know enough about digital camera to recognize the feature that set them apart but i have not do any specific research on this camera but be the gear head i be when i discover this gem at a severely reduce clearance price i snatch it up i know at that ti ame that polypus make some very nice camera in both traditional and digital format my i impulse on this one seem to be right on i have be use the camera for several week now and be incredibly i impress with the convenience a quality digital camera can provide the camera be a 2 1 meg pipe this be basically all the quality you need for almost any application picture for the web turn out great print picture in x and x look amaze you can even stretch it to 8x10 without much of a major i impact 1600 x 1200 picture be produce by most set but you can cut down the size to increase the room for picture the x optical and x digital be something that be fairly hard to find in a camera in this price range if your in the camera business you know that polypus make great quality lens you will know the a good quality lens will create a good picture these hold true with the d510 if you would not know the difference between optical and digital room optical be the physical adjustment of the lens to get a close picture digital si amply take the picture then crop and besides it to the desire room this be only useful if you want a big picture and in most case the quality be decrease x optical be more then enough for my use the digital room be nice to have but i do not use it much because i can crop if necessary use software on my pp a beautiful feature polypus include be the ability to tongue the use of digital room the room button be si amply a rocket switch locate next to the shutter button if your use the lead screen a a view finder you will notice it will display a visual guide show how much room be currently be apply this guide also show when you be make use of digital room or just optical room another small feature but it illustrate the think that wa put into this design the camera ha a host of other feature that set it apart from others u auto connect give you an amaze amount of flexibility and allow window to recognize the camera a an external hard drive and let your si amply drag and drop the file you want when you combine this with window up s digital camera wizard you could not ask for anything easy this also allow you to use this camera a a card reader for any of your smart medium card speak of smart medium card the camera include a mb card in box which allow for just few than 20 high quality shoot turn down the quality slightly and get in upwards of 50 the ability to plug your camera into a video input on a to be a great addition to the already complete feature set when your on a trip and do not have the ability to get a hold of a computer for a few minute to view your picture si amply plug in the standard sca output cable and connect it to any to an instant slideshow polypus wa nice enough to include this cable in the package bud to you polypus the quickly ame movie capture feature allow you to take short movie clip 25 second long the length of ti ame and lack of audit capture make this almost painless but i have find that i have use it for record lab result in various class at school the d 510 look great on paper but how doe it perform in the real world open the box give display various document include your user manual and software it ha two table u and video out a set of ni be battery a mb card a wristband and the camera it itself everything you need to get go be there although the inclusion of an ac adapt would have be appreciate the actual camera be somewhat bulky compare to small model offer by he canon and full the new d520 share si similar specification but be almost half the depth of the d510 and doe not rest note solid of the d510 the d510 case feel si similar to brush aluminium give it a professional feel and style it still fit into a pocket on my rather large part but be good suit to remain in a case in a purse or backpack the picture that come out of the camera be bright and vivid and i 146ve print many in a variety of size one of my picture recently win and place in a photo contest picture land of the live sky available at www barndoorfanclub org gallery twilight twilight html the variety of shutter speed and aperture set can be useful for someone with more experience in work with traditional sir but i find that let the camera automatically choose proper set tend to produce excellent picture have say that most of my low light picture turn out le than i impressive unless i play with the set myself the user manual include a great guide on how to take the best picture in a variety of situation and be worth read through the software be not very useful although it doe allow you to take a number of shoot and digital 147stitch 148 them together to make a panorama the result of the stitch function look very professional i do most of my picture touch up with wa his not shop pro i purchase two thing with my camera a limb smart medium card and a small camera case the limb allow me to capture 30 high quality picture and then the mb can be use a a back the case protect the camera wherever i go and hold the u cable and the extra memory card ni be rechargeable battery be on my list of thing to pick up a with most digital camera the d510 eat battery it be best to keep an extra set with the case a we will the battery life indicator only show when the battery be just about to die and will otherwise show a full charge until it 146s too late reason to buy powerful camera 2 1 up x optical x digital these feature alone make it a desirable and very functional camera to have low cost the price point i 146ve see for this camera make it a viable option for a christmas present or just a a straight replacement for a mmm for those new to digital camera i impressive picture result photo be bright and colourful perfect for print with a photo printer or get professionally print it 146s just fun to use the ability to take a picture of something at a get together show it on a slideshow late that night print out a copy for everyone there and then have it post on a webster the next day make it fun to use thing to watch out for no camera case best to pick one of these gun up a good one can be have for under 20 software be weak besides the ability to stitch panorama the software wa relatively weak and only useful a a photo viewer something that window up doe naively quite we will menu system like other review the venus do require some get use to and i frequently have to refer back to the manual to track down specific feature some effort could be make to craft a le into agitate system conclusion the polypus d510 be a solid performer right of the box with 2 1 up and x optical room it be the perfect replacement for a traditional mmm or sir user expert lament with the new digital camera technology although i do have some complex not about what be include camera and what isn 146t they be relatively insignificant compare to the quality and usefulness of the camera overall out of all the camera i have try out before and after the purchase of my d510 i be still i impress with the quality it produce for the price the d510 be best of class update i leave my digital camera in my glove box by accident and over the course of two day wa involve in some amateur rally race unfortunately i have not leave the camera in it be case and some of the pipe on the lead review screen have go out i have not go a hold of polypus yet but will publish my experience with technical support a soon a i finalize what be go on
65;Camera;let s begin with what come out of the box the imp today ls443 camera with build in limb memory a lock station a battery ac adapt u cable let me begin by say thank today for not make u spend 100 extra dollar on thing like the ac adapt and battery which should be include in the first place this be my opinion on the camera i love it for it be picture quality but i dislike it for not make me feel so great about myself when i take a picture what doe this mean we will when you see most camera the lead be so crisp you can see if you roof up the picture when you take it therefore you can quickly ease it and take another snapshot with the ls443 you take a picture and the display on the screen be not always all that great so you can not tell if it will be flurry or if there be too much light keep this in mind when purchase the camera luckily the picture quality be so top notch with this camera i wa able to foresee the lack of lead display a far a the lens be concern it be a high end propriety schneider kreuznach variogon lens there be a x optical room and 3 x digital room for a total six room in case you would not know how the room work this be the difference optical room be a lens change cause a picture to be snapshotted a if you we be physically close to the object you be capture this mean that the picture be a good quality a it would be if you we be physically near the camera it itself digital room be a hardware software approach to boom in on a particular object at a certain distance this type of room cause pixelation and destroy the overall quality of the picture i do not even bother use digital room i have it turn off if you be look to get a camera with great quality and room only look at optical room not digital if you would look at digital make sure that the camera be of high megapixels because you will need them when digital boom in the autofocus on the camera be great you hold the button down half way and a little green box on the camera s lead turn red this mean that the camera be focus and you can depress the button all the way to snapshot the picture i immediately after that the i damage be display on the screen and you be ready for your next shoot fortunately today take a huge step be combine the picture mode with the review mode this mean that you can hit the review button at any ti ame in picture mode and it will show you all the picture store on the memory card this help a lot so you would not have to physically turn the camera into a different mode every ti ame you want to review a picture there be also an independent delete and share button available that way you can i immediately delete a picture if you would not like it or you can hit the share button which will allow you flag the picture to be remain to a previously set list via computer software of possible recipient a soon a you wouldock the camera it will prompt you to email out the picture you have flag a far a the mode be concern on the camera it contain the follow movie mode this be with sound and it also play back sound the quality be not so great but you can not expect much from a digital camera also you would not have the ability to room in and out during record since it will make noise and be capture auto mode this mode be great for everyday picture of people object at a reasonable distance it take the best picture dependent on the current situation the autofocus be perform by an independent blue light which shine prior to the snapshot and focus the camera sport mode this be ideal for object in motion and will increase the shutter speed thus try to avoid blurriness micro mode this be for object that be close than cm flash be automatically disable and this option work great i ve use it many ti jam night ti ame mode this be great for night ti ame when light be readily available the shutter speed be decrease and hence more light be absorb however this mean that even a slight shake in your hand will output a flurry i damage thus you need some sort of try when take these type of picture landscape mode this set the lens to infinite focus there be no redbox greenbox to indicate focus this mode work fantastic and i ve use it many ti jam to take great picture of scenery a far a the option be concern on the camera it itself you have the ability to set it to multiple mode which will take up to 3 shoot in a row work great for object in motion you also have the ability to change the flash type to automatic always on red eye reduction or off red eye reduction be a little weird since it flash twice instead of flicker first and then flash this mean your guest will assume that the picture wa take on the first flash and start to move right at the ti ame the actual picture be take be careful of this and warn them ahead of ti ame the picture can be take in color black and white or sophia the old day look there be control to increase or decrease white exposure for snowy day or day there be too much or too little light there be the ability to set the quality of the picture you can make it the full 4 megapixels 2 2 megapixels or 1 megapixel with a 128mb card you cannonade 103 picture at best quality a far a the card be concern this camera us a secure digital multi medium card these be generally much more expensive than compact flash or smart medium however it ha limb of internal memory which be use once the card be fill the camera come with a lock station when you place the camera on the lock station it begin to charge and i immediately allow you to transfer over picture to your computer charge ti ame be about 2 hour which be much good than the sonya duc put which require 13 hour an excellent feature of the camera be that you can physically connect the same ac adapt and same u that go into the lock station right into the side of the camera this mean you cannotransfer pick to any computer without carry around the entire lock station however take note that the ac adapt when plug directly into the camera will

72;Camera;i have use mmm camera in the past and some other digital camera and the today ls443 put all those other one to shame once you start take picture then you will know what i be talk about when you first download the picture to your computer you will be amaze at the picture quality and how vagrant the color look also the camera come with the lock station that make the transfer of picture very fast and easy now for the review b picture quality and memory first off the picture quality the camera ha three set for picture quality at the high set the picture be very close to what a regular mmm film camera would do also at this set you can get some great 4 by 6 or 8 by 10 print the specification say you can get up to 20 by 30 print but i have not try those i think the recommend size be up to 11 by 14 with those three size this camera be perfect for most user the high set of the camera be 4 meg pipe the second set be 2 2 meg pipe and the last set be 1 meg fix i mostly use the 4 up set when take most of my picture but i have use the 1 up set when i want to send email to people at the high set the picture be about 1 megabyte in size so i would recommend buy a memory card of at least 128 mb i personally buy a 256 mb card and with that i cannonade over 200 picture at the high quality set and about nineteen minute of video in movie mode the difference in price between the 128 and the 256 mb card be not that much the actual specification on how many picture you cannonade depend on the card size can be see at the today site b control in some review that i read some people have say that the shutter button be spongy and it be hard to control this wa not the case with me to get the camera to take the best picture possible you would hold down the shutter button half way and then the camera would automatically set the focus and the flash set when it doe that then you just press the shutter button all the way down to take the picture some people say that it take a long ti ame to auto focus but this be not the case the camera be ready to take the picture quite quickly the room be quite good i just recommend that you would not use the digital aspect of it only the optical i take a few picture use the digital room and the picture quality drop off somewhat the camera operate in several mode the only one that i have not use yet be the night mode so i can not comment on it but all the other mode do exactly what they say they can do for example my little nephew wa run around so i put the camera in sport mode and the picture come out great very focus with no slur this be another thing that other people have complain about and i do not see why that be why the camera ha all these different mode so you can get the best picture during different situation the camera also ha a lot of manual control for set up the exposure white balance where to focus iso and other thing so there be a lot of stuff that novice picture take can play around with most of the ti ame i have the camera set in automatic mode but to get all the other feature to work right you just have to expert agent and take picture in different condition to see what work best the manual guide of the camera explain each function pretty we will so you can pick up all the feature pretty quickly every ti ame you switch to a new mode there be a quick explanation of what it doe so this make the camera very easy to operate b lead one of the son of this camera be the lead first of all the picture quality in the lead be not good at all when i take a few picture i think they we be all come out bad when i view them use the review feature of the camera the photo do not look clear and the color look a bite off that be a different case when you see the picture on a computer then you can really see what the camera can do also i wa take some picture outdoor and you can barely see the i damage on the lead screen also at night you can not see anything on the screen it would have be nice if they would have add control to the lead screen to change the contrast or the brightness to adjust to these condition these drawback be not that bad and can be overlook because of the picture quality of the camera

74;Camera;this be an excellent camera technically however recent experience i have encounter have lead me to change my mind the only problem be that there be only a few model available in the market in this category please see my previous review it rank high in lens quality performance ease of use and manual overrule capability the lack of a wife lead screen be very sadly omit by minorca the ability to switch between manual and automatic focus by accidentally touch the button be a poor design feature a be the placement of the neck strap ring over the cf door the advertise ago shutdown feature be really a sad feature minorca should really look into this and either remove it or advertise it iso that you be not catch use it while meet an i damage at the same ti ame the end result for me wa the corruption of all my i damage in my cf card which cause me to spend to recapture the lose i damage the attitude receive in the repair department wa a real shock to me i have never encounter this in my life a a consumer at canon i have always be treat a a consumer with respect and professionalism a a result i will never buy another one of their product in the future

81;Camera;digital camera be very much like computer by now wait six month and you brand new camera will be top and out feature by the new release but much like my computer i want something that work we will be dependable and give me what i need in this case i want an easy and convenient camera that take good picture the polypus d 490 room be ideal because not only doe it give me what i want but it do not cost a ridiculous amount a we will first and foremost i should mention a couple of element that be always talk about when address digital camera and that i need to keep in mind while shop around say element be megapixels and storage megapixels by now digital camera be come out with 4 megapixel camera for around 1000 dollar i be sure in 5 year they will be 300 just like 2 megapixel camera go through not so long ago megapixels be essentially the number of pipe that make up your picture and the high the number of megapixels the more fine detail your picture be 1 megapixel camera be the flashbulb wind up camera of the must century to your average store clerk by now and though i d like to think the 2 1 polypus d 490 room be not yet it probably will be in no ti ame but unless you be a forensics detective charge with analyze evidence photo the 2 1 megapixels crank out huge gorgeous picture that will suit any occasion i ve see high quality camera result and yes they be good but only in the same way platino be good than gold storage there be different way to save your picture in memory to place on your computer some take regular 3 5 inch floppy disc sonya take their special memory stick and several take sand s smartmedia card which be a little small than two postage stamp yet store a lot more than the floppy kind and be much more common than sonya s specialize memory storage system the d 490 room come with an be card and you can purchase large one for a semi expensive price but keep in mind for this and all purchase concern this camera that if you count enough picture you will end up save money if you consider all film and develop purchase you will not ever bother with again incidentally for more information concern both of these slightly tricky element and several others you really should give think to before buy a digital camera seek more information on the net or what i do which be study the large article in a semi recent consumer report magazine that greatly help me out a for the camera it itself i ve be very happy with it it doe crank out high quality picture you can use the typical view finder which save power or the screen build into the back it ha a convenient flash with several option anti red eye long distance for darken scenery even long distance anti red eye i can scan all picture a soon a i take them take multiple shoot if i think one hasn t come out we will and delete any that do not and best of all cannonade countless stupid insane and good picture that i normally would ve never waste film on it ha a fifty little room that can also be set to digital though to be frank i ve hear negative thing about digital room so it be at the end of the list of thing i ve yet to learn about the camera and that lead me to one of the only drawback with so many option come a rather complicate on screen menu and it display on menu while the camera s on and another when off which can be confuse but my opinion be that you have to take the bad with the good you could have le complex venus with a camera that ha le functionality while point out the negative the d 490 room doe not include an ac adapt nor doe it have a u connection also regular a battery be not suppose to be use with it there be a special kind design for high end electronics which i do not know until i have already purchase it finally the only way to turn off the camera be to close the slide door but it be dangerously close to the telescope lens which make me wonder if they could have design it a bite good otherwise i be completely out of son but i be be purposefully critical finally i be a big believer that this camera will pay for it itself after i take enough picture with it i plunge on this purchase buy the camera on sale but also buy special rechargable battery make for digital camera the recharger and a flashpath sand floppy disk adapt to make transfer the picture from camera to computer infinitely easy that be the next critique i ll crank out all together it cost me around 650 i figure that after 1000 picture the camera will have pay for it itself i ve only have it for le than two month and it be already 1 th of the way there consider everything the polypus d 490 room be a great product it be dependable solid build offer load of function and fun to use it deserve a solid four star and definite consideration if you be think of buy a digital camera and for the freedom and fun digital camera offer the entire concept deserve a gleam five star
82;Camera;describe your experience use this product when i use this camera it be mainly to take picture of my friend and special life ame event that go on like go to party or other fun function i use it completely in lieu of a normal 35 mm camera and it operate just a easily i think it be great because on the little screen in the back you cannotell if you blink in the picture and if you would i immediately retake the picture so you would not have to wait to get the film develop to find out that the picture wa horrible because you blink or put your head in a weird position and get a double chin etc it be great for that purpose when i try to take picture of my dog with it though be where i find that it be not so great they be not the most patient of subject they often will not hold the pose a long a a human so the picture be all a matter of luck why do you buy this product i get the camera a a gift for granulate from college so i could document my travel after granulation it be perfect for that i take it with me everywhere and have great quality picture from everywhere i go it wa lightweight and easy to carry around with me everywhere so i do not worry about it at all in fact i have it in my small purse and do not even remember most of the ti ame because it wa so lightweight what do you love about this product obviously so far you cannotell that i love the picture quality and the lightweight and ease of use the camera be great for amateur photography or just document your life what do you hate what i do not like about the camera be that i have have it for a short amount of ti ame and have have to buy the battery for it 4 ti jam already of course some we be completely my fault like for leave it plug into my computer overnight so it drain the battery keep it itself awake or when it open the slide front when i do not have it in a bag in my purse so the camera wa just sit there wait to take picture but just the same it be irritate because the local radio shock doe not carry the battery in stock so i have to order them the other thing i do not like be the inability to room into thing really far away one night i saw a picture of the moon that wa absolutely amaze and want to take a picture of it to use a my background on my monitor i take the picture and get it home only to realize that all i have wa really sky the moon wa so tiny that you could not even tell it wa really there
83;Auto;when the gas price go way up in the spring it wa ti ame to trade in my beloved they truck and find something that wa good on gas i have a favorite leadership so i try to find a car on their lot after drive a few different car i settle on the 1998 return s that wa on their lot needle to say i love it we have a family car but my return be the car i drive to and from work work be 17 mile each way so i need something that wa great on gas mileage drive around town only the car get at least 30 mile per gallon that be my kind of car this be the first return i have ever own and i will look for another one when it be ti ame this car wa use with 44 000 mile on it i have not have it in the shop yet and it run great i change the oil faithfully every 2500 3000 mile the car be a 5 speed so i suppose that help a little on the gas mileage i have a few kiss and they ride comfortably in the backseat when we take the car anywhere we would not take the car on trip because there be not a whole lot of room but it be great for short distance we will what else can i say about this little car the trunk be huge it shift easily and ha clot of sink and the price wa reasonable and fit into my budget br br
84;Auto;our 1996 dodge non buy new now with 55 000 mile ha be a great value economical to buy economical to operate 44 pg highway 32 34 pg city reliable we buy our non because the sell price 9100 wa low it ha never fail u it always start right up even in sub zero weather it be easy to his nothing i do my own oil change it candle reasonably we will at all speed only a couple of thing that i do not like the 96 doe not have full frame door and one door ha develop a rattle the leave windshield wipe be large than the right windshield wipe so that replace them require a purchase of two different size refill these be minor problem i would definitely buy another non and recommend the non to anybody seek excellent value br br
85;Auto;hi i be peter and i be a car enthusiast i have read about this car and drive it a lot despite the fact that i still do not own one what be great about this car be that it be the most reliable car on the road in my opinion precede ha always be know a a reliable car company but they take it a step far when they create this sleek new e class another great aspect about this car be that it be also safe it ha the side airbags and head curtain for add safety when i wa look into the car in this price range i wa stick between get the bow 5 series and this e class i really like the power and luxury of the bow but i also like how the precede drive each of these car be excellent but what strike me to be strange wa how much more smarten the precede wa than the bow i could easily tell that precede put all of their energy into make this car from the engine and body out while the bow focus more on the interior comfort i know that when you go to look at this car you will see the 40 000 price tag and think that it be too expensive do not whatever you would look at this car a just a car this be an investment what i suggest to do be to get the most out of this car if you opt for an e 300 wa not make in 2000 but will be back in 2001 or 2002 you will get a much good value this car will last a long a you you can buy it when you be 16 and drive it when you be 50 just think of how many ti jam you would have to buy a new car if you consistently buy a ford focus also this car with the vessel engine ha a great gas mileage for these reason get an e 300 diese and save money on your next car br br
86;Auto;i have to be honest with you perhaps i be base but i ve always be a precede girl from my dad s first 240d to his 380 s i wa in heaven he be just turn in his sun and wa on the prowl for something fun fast and preferably a convertible we look at everything from a porch boxer audit s bow s stab and beyond a a last resort dad head out to the precede dealer though he would always be in love with precede he would not think this car wa the answer to say that joy shine from his face the first ti ame he wouldrove it wa an understatement he have find his nirvana it come in the form of a silver 2001 precede slk380 i have be with hi be in his vehicle pursuit we would try everything i find the boxer fun but we lose out on that one i think the bow s we be very disappoint we try a 6 speed and an automatic and both lack any of the power or pizazz i have expect the scab s we be nice but a little too family torment this precede wa the first two seat i have actually find come the seat hug your back no matter what size you may be there be an amaze amount of leg room i be 5 10 which be always a requirement in any car i either drive or sit a a passenger the control we be a little hard to decipher at first pass glance but the little lip chart they provide with the car answer any and all question i find it interest that they sell the d change a an option and of course the car can only have the precede change nothing like protect their interest but the addition of the change wa a good choice the wardrop be a great thing the prior 380sl we own have the detachable wardrop which wa to say the least cumbersome and difficult to store the wardrop provide great disability no replace the top on this car and give a sleek line than some other convertible in it be class an amaze option that i have never hear of before wa the automatic transmission that could also be drive a a 5 speed i be not any sort of expert on car so pardon me while i still wipe the look of now i do not know they could do that off my face it be a nice option a you can choose the kind of drive you want i find the drive solid and stable it hug the curve and fly down any straightaway the only few drawback be a follow 1 when the top be down you can almost completely forget about the trunk sure you could fit a few bag in there but do not expect to throw the top down while on a cross country journey unless of course you pack light 2 the get behind the driver head can cause some sight i impairment while back up with the top down and it be a his not take it off and put it back on late overall for the price tag i find this car to be the best value in it be class it be sport it be elegant and it be class plus it come with a great warranty and get decent mileage
87;Camera;i buy this camera a an i impulse purchase but unlike most such purchase i have no regret it take the best picture i ve see from a moderately price camera and i can not believe the detail i get in night shoot i take picture of the last ulnar ellipse and i wa able to room right in and get all the detail even the cloud near it it ha a low battery life and i would strongly recommend buy a battery charge and 8 rechargeable battery make the only negative feature a positive
88;Auto;i purchase my 1991 accord use a year ago this past april this be my fourth hand product i purchase all the others with we will over 100 000 mile on them and they all run fearlessly and i get each of them to over 200 000 before sell not scrap them this specie amen have 121 000 on it then and be push 155 000 now i snap it up right away because it wa the only accord wagon i d ever see with a 5 speed despite a few character flaw i attribute to previous owner bone headdress such a a break antenna cheerily tint window and rusty rear quarter a flaw common to all old hand but easily presentable with periodic inspection and clear of the rear tender drain i be a musician and i have load my accord to the hill with heavy musical gear it ha never complain and even load down will return 25 pg it candle great and with a 5 speed be surprisingly quick i have have my share of fun dust the occasional slam i import or focus and enjoy i immensely the look on the driver s face a he she watch my rear jumper bounce up and down between shift the interior be likewise mint with the exception of a pioneer head unit and d change i have replace the power antenna but will soon need a new one my fault not the car s also i have retrofit a set of accord ex six speak allow what i have end up with i feel be a remarkably we will build sick look but not ostentatiously efficient little hauler that can scott pretty we will when you ask it to if you can find one with a manual they be out there but rare i say go for it even in general i can not recommend the accord wagon enough i d buy another one in a second do not think i ll need to for a while though
89;Camera;after take the ti ame to really learn my camera i be thrill with it i be guess i be not the only one that go from a nice point and shoot 35 mm camera to a digital i receive mine a a holiday gift or perhaps i would have realize i wa buy something beyond my expertise forget the manual i have good luck with third party book specifically so you buy a digital camera now what sell at barge noble sonya really need to support the buyer with a full pledge operate manual for both the camera and the accompany par down version of software that you get that allow you to use the photograph that say my only other grip would be the delay the focus feature cause in get action shoot i always think that hold down the shutter part way freeze the action but now realize the camera be only freeze the focus and if you follow through and take the shoot it will not be the i damage you saw freeze in the display but a second or two late you can always use the movie set to record action but you can not extract individual frame a would seem possible the quality of what you would get be amaze i love to be able to change the photo from it be original color to septum or to black in white right on the camera without affect the original photo the movie mode ha be a great way to preserve family shipper in size easily e fail the battery life be incredible i have always have the battery to do what i want something that almost never happen with our sonya video camera the viewfinder come in real handy when bright outside light render the lead screen invisible and it can be adjust for those of you that wear glass i use my camera just about every day and i be always happen upon new feature new to me anyway i may have be please with a le expensive camera option but i truly can not i imagine be without digital now
90;Camera;we need a digital camera for construction site photo at work so know i be a cadet and camera freak they assign me to be the buyer of a digital camera i find the c 211 at a clearance sale for 135 00 here be my opinion b what you get into the polypus c 211 come with a large set of multi lingual instruction manual and a quick start guide we will write and hard to come across in this day where more and more camera maker be put their manual on c d disk you of course get the c 211 camera a neck strap and len s cap a u cable for photo download a video cable for view photo on a television a pack of polaroid 500 film and an 8 meg smart medium memory card a you can guess you will want to buy a large card a you will only get about 5 i damage on an 8 meg card at the camera s fine set a set of a battery and software c d top off the list of in the box good b the good in polypus tradition photo quality be very good show lot of detail and nice if perhaps a bite subdue color with a top resolution of 1600 x 1200 pipe 2 megapixel you will be able to print excellent 5 x 7 photo and some pretty nice 8 x 10 photo too on my h p printer use photo paper the photo we be great but use the self serve lab printer at my local walgreens the photo we be outstanding these self serve printer can be find at wa mary v and neck drug store too you can of course set the camera for a low 640 x 480 fix size and use these photo for email or web page there be two quality set at this low size and on screen even they look very nice with lot of detail though they will not look very good via your printer you can however use the c 211 s build in polaroid printer to print even these low resolution photo with decent result since the polaroid be only 2 x 3 inch in size i find the polaroid print to be decent in quality i ve see good from an inject printer of course but they be a bite good than print from an actual polaroid camera in the camera s set you can adjust the print photo contrast and brightness to some degree besides the two fix size of photo you can adjust quality set a we will either standard quality sq for web use high quality he for everyday photo super high quality she for print and stiff mode no compression for even more detail large print be aware that stiff print require ton of space on a memory card so use sparingly and only if you really want a good 8 x 10 print the lens be a 3 x optical room good with a digital room option which i avoid a digital room always degrade an i damage s quality the lens be treat so you can screw on 35 mmm size filter a big plus to me since many digital camera still do not have this ability without add awkward adapt to the lens i recommend get a cheap up filter right off the bat to protect the main lens your lens cap will still clip on to the front of the filter 35 mmm be a somewhat awkward size but you can find them in li unite supply at rite camera store only through special order at wolf camera however the menu and control button be arrange nicely on the back of the camera next to the color lead display the room control be via a tongue type lever that surround the control button easily readable with your thumb the menu button school you through the camera s various set include set up the camera for the 15 second video mode 352 pipe in size photo quality mode and more a large print button allow you to print the photo you be view on the lead screen via the build in printer push it and poor out pip a polaroid that develop fully in about 5 minute b the bad the c 211 us 4 a size battery anyone who ha use digital camera before though know that off the shelf alkaline battery be eat like candy by these thing and i find that alkaline have an extremely short life in the c 211 since there be no optical viewfinder on this camera you must rely on the color lead to be on at all ti jam to compose your photo and since the lead be the large battery drain part of a camera this contribute to short battery life 15 20 shoot max try some rechargeable ni be battery my result we be a bite good maybe 50 photo use the lead room and flash on about one fifth of the shoot note you can use a u memory smart medium card reader to download your photo into the computer instead of the camera s u cable to conserve battery power the lead be a on most digital camera hard to see outdoor in bright sunlight there be a flap that open above for daylight use that i improve visibility somewhat but just be prepare to quiet a bite in sunlight when compose photo an anti glare coat on the lead s glass would have help size doe matter when it come to carry about a digital camera all day and here the c 211 be a whisper roughly 9 inch tall and thick to accommodate the printer it be big by any camera s term and the include neck strap be definitely need you will not carry this in one hand all day at the too i be not sure i should list this a a bad thing a axis nowhere s si amply no way they could have include a printer without the camera be this size but if you be look for a carry around digital camera this would be a liability b extra the manual suggest that a 64 meg smart medium card be the large size card you can use for this camera but i have a 128 meg card in ours and it work fine with the camera set at 1600 x 1200 pipe and she i cannonade roughly 90 photo with such a large card card be cheap now so stock up so you would not run out of fix power b final in term of digital i damage quality i give the c 211 a large thumb up the polaroid print i give a decent grade too in quality they have mute color and can be a bite grain but axis they re good than standard polaroid camera print usually be in term of size however i have to say that i would recommend this camera more for field use by people in the construction field police fire insurance or real estate agent a oppose to the casual snap short who want to carry a camera to out and gather for le money you can still find an polypus d 490 which be essentially the same camera minus the build in printer and be much small if you would need a printer camera however the c 211 be a good one to have look for bargain too some store be still try to get 599 for this thing and i have see them on sale for a little a 135 00 clearance to 249 00 occasional office max sale so shop around and happy snap

compensation and external flash option the two late union offer the up 990 and the professional do both fit the bill we would all be use the do if we could afford it but after consult the checkbook my consideration come down to either date my union or brave the water on a first generation product with the new sonya mavra d 1000 the destination for my digital work be peri angrily the web so the difference between a 2 or 3 megapixel camera be negligible if my final product be a print there be still no substitute for film b much good i damage quality than previous magical in the past i ve be a snow for the quit nikkor glass quit and that influence my decision in the digital format a we will with the previous generation of magical the floppy file size li agitation put the i damage quality far below my standard nevermind the quality of the glass with a firm step forward sonya ha break through that barrier by exchange the flop for co increase the capacity a hundredfold now that the new mavra be not cripple by disk size the real quality of the photo can be see without the overbear pg compression while base on the same body and electronics the d 1000 s normal file size be three ti jam large than it be sister mavra ff 95 that mean le loss compression and clean original there be even the option to write totally compress liffs and this be the one camera that ha the storage capacity to do it the new d 1000 cover most of my wishlist give me much more manual control than the previous 900 i wa use to i be still wait for the day when i can match my favorite glass to a digital cod but until then this new sonya will fit the bill the new mavra offer one i important advantage over the union a a vacation camera while travel abroad the d r capable mavra ha unchanged me from the lawton instead of the hour choose of move all the i damage to a hard drive to clear up room i can now si amply swap in a new disc 6 for a pack of 5 each one hold 170 full resolution i damage b still camera in camcorder clothe the most suspect feature i ve find be the brilliant i damage stabilization technology while use the long six telephone or the micro mode this bitter reduce feature really give you a tack sharp photo even with le than steady hand you can now forget the try for quick micro shoot this still camera act more like a modify video unit than a traditional sir and sorrow heavily from sonya s camcorder expertise it ha a comfortable sir feel with an economic grip in one way i admire the large more traditional pro summer look but i also miss the stealth possible from the small rotate coolpix body add on the external flash bracket and a lumiquest and this mavra will let you mix shyly in with any pro photographer my standard film gear include union fa and old heavy lens so the business and weight be not a retraction to me but be warn that this be one of the large digicams you be likely to lift the lens haired with the d 1000 be a six monster that give you the mmm equivalent of 39 390mm for my shoot style i d much rather have something on the wide end and le telephone necessary accessory include the wide angle adapt 50 and external flash unit 100 luckily this camera free you from the coolpix necessary accessory of battery charge and a card reader the mavra include sonya s smart lithium ion battery technology which charge inside of the camera and also communicate with the body to let you know exactly how many minute of life it ha leave the battery charge in 3 to 4 hour last over two hour with lead and extra be 50 each another unique feature of the sonya be dual lead screen a decent one on the back and another inside the viewfinder turn off the large one save battery power and have the small one allow you to shoot just like an sir b great piece but too expensive of course there be downside with any first generation product the disability of a portable d write mechanism be often question but this mavra ha perform fearlessly so far even while try to make the laser skin when write this delay while the d record bring up the big frustration with the new mavra the wait from press the shutter to the next available frame be still far too long i understand this be a li amid of the technology but why not use a si ample ram suffer to allow a series of 5 photo before have to write to the disc the delay actually be not a bad a i expect often between 3 and 4 second about the same a my old union which wa si amply write to a smartmedia card despite the long reach telephone and i damage stabilization this camera be not capable of high level sport photography anything above little league and the action will be too fast for the camera to handle of course this can be say about any digital camera currently under 5000 the manual rouse ring be too small and not precise enough for quick follow rouse skill while a digital with manual focus might interest those want more control try to focus the small grain lead be nothing like use a bright sir viewfinder the mavra d 1000 be not the perfect digital but it may be the best yet in combine quality i amaze with ease of use while still allow enough manual adjustment for the pro in all of u it be currently overprice you pay a 300 premium for the d capability over the sister mavra but should be in the 1000 range soon enough sonya put together a great package of feature and finally produce a model that will get the attention of serious amateur photographer br br

100;Auto;back in january i start look for a new car to replace my acute integral it multi lately come down to the bow 328ci and audit a 2 8 i like the more aggressive say of the bow 3 series but i could not justify the 38 000 price tag for the 328ci about k more for essentially 20 more horsepower v the 323ci so in the multi mate feat of rationalization i often for the audit s which wa k more than the 328ci with the add benefit of 60 more horsepower full ti ame 4 wheel drive and an extra 2 door i end up order a 2001 model at the end of march and it arrive at the dealer at the end of june the major difference between the 2000 and 2001 model be 1 k high stick price 2 addition of esp electronic stability program 3 sport package become an add cost option and 4 long warranty for ask mi be prepare for a wait if you plan on purchase the s since it be a li unite production car especially in california i ve have my 2001 s for about 1700 mile now and i ve love every single mile of it it be metallic silver with the onya black interior with the premium package ak convenience package on the 2000 model and bone audit system i often to not get the 6 disc change option since the dem unit panasonic can be have for 279 aftermarket v 650 instal with the car b engine performance this car be a pleasure to drive it be get incredible true at low rum s 258 lb ft 1850 3600 rum so acceleration be effortless and downright wicked if you floor it it take a while for me to get use to the car s power a i wa unintentionally launch like a rocket at green light since i wa use to the engine of my former true weak acute integral also the car be very compose at highway speed so much so that i often do not realize that i wa go 80 may when i think i wa go 60 since the cabin be very quiet and compose the six speed take a little get use to since the reverse gear be next to 1 2 you push down then leave past 1 2 then up whereas on my integral it wa down from th gear the throw be much long a we will feel like you will be elbow people in the back seat which be the only real driveability drawback that i see in this otherwise amaze car an aftermarket short shift be definitely on the upgrade list the car be after all a 4 door sedan so it be not nearly a possible a my old integral there be more lean that i would like when i toss the car from side to side but it be pretty taut for a stock suspension regardless i feel it be get a good balance between performance and comfort i ve autocrossed the car once and it definitely need a stiffen and low suspension for these type of event but for everyday drive it be a good compromise oh yeah there be quite a lively aftermarket for the s there be at least 4 aftermarket tune that you can go to for a new eau which will easily bump your horsepower in the 310 he range stock be 250hp and true into the 360 ft le range stock be 258 ft le for about 500 600 so if you ever tire of the stock 250hp engine you have get option b interior the front seat be comfortable and i never felt fatigue from the seat during extend drive i wish the side bolster we be a little more beef or adjustable though the rear seat be quite cramp and i wish audit would have make the cavernous trunk a little small so that passenger would have a little more bedroom they would almost be more comfortable lay down in the trunk if you have ever see the truck of the s a you will know what i mean if the trunk wa not big enough for you you can also fold down the 60 40 rear seat and fit your grocery for the next 6 month in there audit place 2 cup holder under the center arm rest he will you need to keep the arm rest up if you want to use either of these cup holder but luckily there be a neat little intractable cup holder in the center console that you have more direct access to drive with the sunroof open at highway speed create a loud drone sound between 35 45 may this be very annoy but my solution be to drive fast it be excusable though to have this happen on a ask car never have this problem in my integral there be also wind noise from the side mirror at highway speed a slight whistle sound too to use the cruise control you have to fiddle with a stalk on the sneer column to accelerate after you activate cruise control you press the button on the end of the stalk but to slow down you have to use a different slide switch which also serf to turn the cruise on off clumsy to say the least i wish they place the control on the sneer wheel like my old integral b exterior the anus ri a be a huge brake dust magnet i ve be tell that apply car wax to the ri a will help with clean any which way i think i ll be clean off brake dust quite often i do not like the say of the ri a initially but it ha grow on me and now i like them b audit the bone system sound pretty decent for a stock radio albeit a little too heavy on the bass i listen to a lot of bass heavy music trance house hip hop etc so the system s bass heavy emphasis work nicely for me but it get a little irritate after prolong listen some jam i have not really crack it up but i have hear from others that the bass get muddy at high volume a we will b his notenance every 2001 audit come with a for 50 000 mile warranty 2001 model receive a long warranty than previous year during which ti ame all schedule his notenance be include with the car purchase even down to replace windshield paper b summary now go get one you will not be disappoint you will notice that the negative that i write up be really all minor it pick consider this a plus since i really do not see any major downpoints with this car br br
101;Auto;i recently take the top three full size pick up for a test drive i own a 2000 silver and wa in the market for another truck for my son i must say i do not drive the my because it really be the same a the they the dodge wa my first choice mostly because it wa the least expensive kind the interior of the dodge wa great it wa a huge wide open area we will instrument and comfortable it give you a good solid feel while sit behind the wheel both the dodge and the they make you feel like you we be drive a livingroom down the road lot of room nice comfortable seat the ford felt kind cramp and a little on the cheese side inside i do not get the feel of quality from ford what a shame they make a good product since kiss be kiss and he will be want to drive around his friend i look at the extend cab version of dodge and they here be where i start to draw my line the dodge s rear seat wa nothing more than just a board cover with cloth very uncomfortable i have the dealer drive me around while i sit in the back i felt like a real sooner sit back there no wonder i use to call shoot gun the they have a large more comfortable seat it still wa not much but it wa much good then for the killer the gas mileage the dodge drink gas compare to the they two mile to the gallon really add up over the year believe me i ve be drive these gas drinker for year and i value my mileage the dodge be a nice vehicle but for a few just a few dollar more i go for the they i felt it have more quality and the mileage will help out in the long haul br br
102;Camera;for anyone look to venture into the world of digital camera you can not go wrong with the mental option all this camera be pack with so many feature that even camera enthusiast will enjoy this camera what be truly surprise be that the option all can be purchase at an amazingly low price of around 200 most other 3 megapixel camera with these type of feature still sell for 300 to 400 let s take a close look b feature while many people myself include tend to only use basic feature and ignore the more complex feature i find myself expert lament and play with all the feature that come load onto the mental option all why be this i think the main reason be because the venus we be so easy to navigable that it wa almost fun a few of my favorite feature be a follow first of all i love the digital filter that come present with the camera these filter include septum b w b w red b w blue our personal favorite b w green blue red and green my wife always pay those over price photo study major buck to add falter to their picture once my wife saw how great this camera take picture use the digital filter she vow to never pay extra at those study ever again a second feature i love be the present camera set that come build in you can choose from portrait flower landscape 3 d panorama night scene or you can mentally program your own set use the sharpness contrast and situation set the option all be one of the few camera in this price range that give you these manual control we tend to use the portrait mode most but i have have fun play around with the panorama mode another less know feature but one of the main reason we buy the camera be the p i be ii capability p i be stand for print i damage watch and what this mean be that your print photo will be enhance use a p i be printer nice market technique since elson be the one sell these printer we buy the elson status photo 825 and receive a 75 debate just because we buy a camera that wa p i be enable you can not beat get a nice photo printer for 25 so how do the p i be enhance picture come out excellent the i damage be crisp clear and vagrant and be identical to what you see when you take the picture we could not be happy let me quickly run down some of the other nice feature the camera ha a x optical and 2 x digital room for an i impressive x combine room i like the position of the room button and it be easy to use close come out sharp and clear it ha a nice wife lead screen that allow you to take self portrait or group shoot this be extremely handy when take a group photo a everyone can see the countdown ti ame and know when the picture will be take you can create a 30 second movie fun to play with but not very good quality or see a slide show of your photo we usually use the include video cable to hook it up to the to to watch the slide show our kiss get a kick out of it you can also protect your favorite photo and save your favorite camera set i also like the fact that you only need two a battery to power the camera a oppose to the four a battery that most other camera require just make sure you use ni be rechargeables which be a wise investment with any digital camera purchase all in all this be one feature pack camera b drawback i ve hear many review of this camera complain about the lack of a viewfinder i ll admit that it would be nice to have a viewfinder but a i use the camera more and more it become le of an issue for me once in a great while i have a hard ti ame see the lead screen in extremely bright sunlight but once i attach the include lead sunblocker just a fly amy piece of black cardboard i could see the lead screen just fine another drawback be the shutter law but i have to say that most camera in this price range have some sort of shutter law what be neat about this camera be that you can halfway depress the picture take button to warm up the camera once you see the red light you can press the button the rest of the way and the photo will be take instantaneously it take some practice but i ve get pretty good at it finally the camera tend to white out the i damage in dark set this be easily solve however if you learn to use the proper set b final comment this be a great 3 34 megapixel camera that give you plenty of bang for your buck sure there be nice 3 megapixel camera out there but you will pay considerably more for them

105;Camera;i ve be a professional photographer for more than 20 year i ve be interest in digital camera for about 9 year when i first purchase an apple quicktake cut camera though the photo look best on screen it wa a start on my digital life though about 8 digicams late i move up to the union d100 i get one of the early patch with one phone call even though i wa on a rite list for age they would not come thou a quick a just pick up the phone on a who be so i ve have this camera for at least 5 month now and use it in my work a a photographer i shoot clot of editorial and or work so my light and situation be always different early on i realize my union s 28 flash would not give good result with this camera and i purchase the s 80dx soon after i realize my rd party lens would be give me error message and would stop sanction when the d100 would not recognize that a lens wa attach so i buy all new union lens big one little one short one expensive one i be not alone when i say that every photo take inside outside and with or without flash be underexpose and not very sharp i ve sit in the same position use every single set that this camera ha and it be not be remedied i ve also use ever union of lens i own from the mmm fish to the 80 200 2 8 d photoshop will fix everything up i use be 7 on a mac but when i do a big job and come back with 1500 i damage the last thing i want be a numb arm and blood shoot eye from be in front of the computer for 2 day make adjustment i have speak with many other pro that have this problem a we will union deny a problem exist but will go on to say that it be careful not to blow out the highlight and white because if that happen you have a completely unable i damage i shoot in peg format since i have to shoot clot and shoot fast so i do not really need the union 3 capture software that cost apex 150 00 but since i have to do color correction and situation adjustment on most i damage i have not find a batch solution that be portable and respectable i have shoot a few raw i damage and they look good i do not purchase the union capture 3 software so after 30 day it expire the best digital software be from the today high end camera it amaze me that union would charge for their software which be not very good anyway i be not sorry i buy the d100 a the pro be that the battery life be excellent and it fit we will in my hand and the weight be good i borrow a dix and it wa too heavy for all day job for me my next digital will most likely be the today in or whatever the big file appeal to me for big print and my stock photography need big file a we will i know oak pro camera have always be the best around and into for their software unless of course union i improve on the d100
106;Camera;even i be some jam guilty of the spontaneous purchase the thrill of say quit yeah i ll take it quit with absolutely no clue whether what you be buy be a quality item or be even worth the price of the fluff sit at the bottom of your pocket buy the duc s wa one of those moment and while it wa an excite purchase my wife and i have want a digital camera for age there wa that little voice softly say quit but what if it be a lemon quit thankful we ignore that little voice because this ti ame throw caution to the wind pay off big ti ame not only have we make a good choice but in fact we would make the good choice the camera wa buy at sear they have the price set at the full retail of 499 with a price match to the local best buy of 399 and the sonya debate of 100 for also buy a vain that be another tale the final price wa 299 plus tax just beautiful what be even more satisfy be that it be easily worth 499 when consider what other si similar camera be go for now so on to the camera set it up wa a breeze really just a few short step attach the lens cover attach the carry strap plug in the battery or hook up to wall power insert the memory stick and you be off or so i think interest anecdote here and remember that i wa new to digital camera i get it all set up thank to the manual which be straightforward and try to take a picture i press the shutter button hear a be saw something on the lead but no picture what i try a million different thing from forget the memory stick to use different resolution to adjust the flash the focus you name it i learn a lot about the camera during that mad frenzy to take a picture that be for sure i wa just about ready to give up and call it break when i notice something in the manual about quit press the shutter button halfway quit oh due with that out of the way i take about 20 picture of everything i could find in the house my wife the cat a pushkin myself nothing wa safe it wa so much fun let s go over the pro of the camera b display b the lead display be very bright and crisp and ai among the camera use it seem natural you can even make it bright with a slide on the side of the camera navigation the camera s many feature use the on screen interface be painless and intuition sonya s menu system be arrange very nicely and the one button controller work surprisingly we will i wa able to try out most of the feature for the first ti ame without refer to the manual b battery b sonya s infolithium battery charge fully in a bite le than two hour and accord to the manual last that long while in use my own experience seem to agree with this a very nice feature be that the camera report the approve mate number of minute of charge remain on the battery very handy b memory stick b sonya s proprietary memory system these little stick hold memory up to 128mb and i hear that 256 and 512mb version be on the way that be a lot of picture understatement we pick up a limb stick with the camera for about 30 since it only come with mb the only problem i can see with these stick be that they be so small it d be very easy to lose track of one transfer from the memory stick inside the camera to the pp be a snap the camera come with a u cable just connect the cable between the camera and the pp the first ti ame you would this it will install some driver include on a d with the camera and away you go the memory stick from that point on be recognize by window a a removable drive and the file be store there a pg or stiff so you can si amply copy them from there to your hard drive or view them right from the memory stick could not hardly be easy b lens picture quality the lens be a x optical room lens with up to x digital room another great feature of the camera be that the level of room be display on a bar on the lead when it be be adjust even good be that it indicate when you be leave optical room and enter digital room mode it also ha a micro mode good for focus at down to cm practically a microscope at that level you can easily make a di ame fill the entire display and still be in focus the picture quality be just outstanding a we will color be vagrant and seem true for a camera in this price range i wa i impress b extra the camera be load with feature but a couple stand out to me first off you can hook up the output of the lead display to a to or anything with a composite video input use a supply cable this mean you can hook it up to a v and actually use it a a movie camera now of course you be li unite by the length of the cable but still also the slide show mode be awesome in this mode a you would expect it cycle through all the photo currently on the memory stick now combine these two feature and you have a stroke of sonya genius run a slide show of your photo on your to the quality of output to the to be really really good i wa amaze by how good it look one final feature i be glad they include wa the ability to store i damage in compress stiff format even though it be a memory how it be really worth it you tend to forget that pg doe degrade i damage quality since it look so good but compare the two you wouldefinitely notice artifact in the pg output take a few photo use the camera s high resolution in stiff format if you want to i empress your friend the son yes there be a couple b no optical viewfinder b most of the ti ame this be not an issue because the digital viewfinder be so bright but in extremely bright condition an optical viewfinder would have be nice b lens button design b i be not terribly fond of the placement for the button which operate the user interface the problem be that i tend to use the thumb of my leave hand to use these button and in this position it be natural for the forefinger of this hand to grasp the camera by the lens often i have to remember not to do that a minor grip to be sure but a grip nonetheless conclusion this camera practically ha it all and then some with a few bonus feature i wa not expect in it be price class it can not be beat and i be extremely please with my quit accidental quit purchase very highly recommend br br
107;Auto;the tooth solar convertible be a huge mistake by tooth it be a butch stock solar instead of a convertible build from the grind up the solar be a good car in many respect pre convertible conversion the acceleration be outstanding on the ve and it be load with lot of amenity if you be will to pay enough this include power everything leather upholstery etc a for the convertible the chop off top result in a lack of stability in the structure and you get a noisy uncomfortable ride the top it itself be poorly design and doe not seem to be 100 air tight occasionally droplet of water will speak in and you will have lot of road noise the car ride quiet with the top down another annoy feature be that you can not bring the top back up unless you be in park the chrysler see allow you to do it if you be go slow enough so if you be catch in lymph traffic with exhaust in your face you can not bring the top up tooth need to design this from scratch to get it right
108;Camera;before i go any far i ll let you know right now that i really like this camera but a with any product there be a few thing i would change also the customer service at today be horrible i think the camera take really good quality picture the color be very bright and the i damage be sharp it ha three different i damage quality set and also allow you to choose between megapixel resolution and 640 x 480 resolution the second option be especially good because some jam you would not want huge screen fill picture that the megapixel set record so you cannonade the picture at the low resolution this option be especially good when design webster with the quality set to the high and the resolution in megapixel mode the camera take about 25 picture with the 8 mb compact flash card that be include but another payoff of the 640 x 480 set be that when set at this resolution at high quality mode the camera can literally take about 60 picture on the 8 mb card i think that be awesome i end up buy another 8 mb card and with just the two card i have more than enough space to take picture on my first trip to new york city early this month the user interface be another really good feature of the camera the on screen menu option be really easy to understand and be in a really user friendly font type ok here be some pet nerve about the camera it eat battery like no other i ve find that the rate that the camera us battery 4 a s be amaze i buy some rechargeable battery and a recharger and that solve my problem the camera be pretty hetty it be a lot heavy than my last camera and ha kind of a bulky shape it will not fit easily into your pocket the rubber cover cover the ac adapt connection the transfer cable connection and the output connection at the side of the camera be kind of cheap feel and fly amy the ti ame it take to transfer picture be really slow a lot slow than my first camera the absolute bad problem with the camera something today really need to work on be it be phone base support it be horrible i really can not stress how negative my experience in this area ha be my ac adapt break and i call to send it in to be repair under warranty the mind alum wait ti ame any ti ame i call wa 15 minute i send the camera to today but instead of come back in 7 10 day like they say it arrive 3 week late but to make thing bad the first ti ame i use the adapt i find that they have not fix the problem i have to call back repeatedly one ti ame be put on hold for over an hour the rep be nice but the wait ti ame be horrible and i be really mad that i have to go through the haste again since they would not fix it the first ti ame ok that be pretty much the end of my commentary on the camera overall i d say it be really good camera a for sure but get s downgrade to a 3 because of my horrible experience on hold for hour upon hour with today if you would like to read on it be just the story of how i get the camera and it compare to my last one the do 210 plus room be my second digital camera my first wa a pretty brand camera that my mon buy me off of all before i go to college it wa a 640 x 480 fix camera that have no room that wa a good first camera but after a while i really want a room lens and good quality picture that first camera cost about 225 i think i begin look around for a camera that have a room lens megapixel ability and good quality picture i literally spend hour browse different webster try to decide which to buy i visit about every different site that have review of camera and comparison test of digital camera for the money it seem that the today wa the best bet i do not buy the camera out of any retail store but instead i buy it on bay from a camera shop in washington for 266 include ship this wa a great price i buy it and end up give my old one to my brother my first camera wa a great one but the picture on the today be a lot good br br
109;Camera;the he 612 be a good family camera it work a a point and shoot for all the family teach idiot which include most of the population but will do enough fancy stuff to keep the shutter navvy busy for a while if you want to focus other than center you can with this one you can room flash set be adjustable include a shut off for those moment ruin by a photo flash bomb burst in air but you would not have to worry about anything if you be a look in the hole or lead screen kind of person there be 3 basic kind of digital camera you can buy the old one with the 3 5 disc storage be be phase out though it seem a nice idea to have the photo on the 3 5 you can not store much you have a bulky camera and disk all over the place the new d mind size be really high dollar but they may very we will be the one that come out on top that leaf the mid range camera like the he 612 that use memory card which be si similar to the 3 5 disk but be small and hold a lot more when i look over the compact flash style camera i decide to go with the he 612 there we be several reason i go with this one after read online and try out digital camera at work and with family camera i just have no shame at all and will say let me check that out so here be how i decide you would not have to be a rocket scientist to use this camera b since i have two little boy and one who especially love to take picture i want a camera that wa really easy to use epi could not take photo with the canon digital from work it wa just too complex even the college student have a neck of ti ame get anything worth print this one involve look in the viewfinder hole and then push the button it work just like his canon owl 35 mm point and shoot which be a wonderful start camera for little gun the box button on the back of the he above the lead viewer mean that the shoot show in the lead to check out shoot just push the button and that be just one click in addition to push the top button to take the picture epi us both those option easy a pie point and shoot and then almost easy a pie with the lead it take hi be about 5 minute to nail the basis on this camera and he be 9 year old it be pocket size b no one want to be the holder of the stuff at the best you can do if you have kiss you have all kind of thing that you have to haul around i never think i would carry the monster purse since i usually jam my i important stuff in my levi s pocket now i do carry the purse and this camera can be tuck right in for the ride it be the size of the regular mmm quick pick camera the he doe not come with any sort of case so i would suggest that you protect it with something you can buy the case or you can use any kind of sturdy little bag i have a little drawstring den be bag that work just fine it keep the camera clean and protect it the carry handle be not the great and will not go around you neck but it be ok i keep the camera in my purse or around my wrist you can buy your battery at the quick trip on the corner b ok i know that a battery be not the best way to go but i like a camera that will work with the garden variety battery perhaps this bias come from live overseas where i have to point and grunt i hat to need thing that i could not describe even in english i still do not know how to say sage in greek and i do not have sage in the dress ball i make that thanksgiving dress ball be not very good without sage give me battery i can recognize at a glance anyway this camera will work with any a battery you stick in the bottom it hold four of those they would not last very long we run through a set of four almost every ti ame we take picture our style be to carry the camera around for a couple of hour and shoot thing at a birthday party or at a cook out we run about 2 roll per set of battery in the 35 mm world or about 48 digital pick if i be the keeper of the camera and i be more careful about the juice then i can get around double the average adult could get 100 photo on a set of battery right now i be save up to get the charge that plug in the wall socket for rechargeable battery we have that at work and it be a good idea you charge and use the battery over and over that will be pretty expensive but it doe pay off in the long run if you can afford the charge and charge battery i would suggest that you get 2 set of battery and rotate those in the camera you can always fall back on the regular a when you have to b if you be think about get this camera then you would need to buy some other thing oh sigh wish it all come together b the real must have would be the medium card actually it work out really nice to have two of those they be like the 3 5 disk but they be small just take the camera to the store and say you need a medium card or you can look in the booklet and find out what you need and buy online check out fat wallet www fatwallet com and click at the top to form and watch the message string you will see good deal come up i get a smart medium card for half the local price by do that but i get the first one at the local store to make sure i get the right thing the reason you want the medium card be that the camera ha only 8 bite of memory that mean about 24 pick store depend on the quality you set that for the default be the mid range if you cannonade the ti ame to check and then discard all unwanted pick on the spot to make room for more or if you stay at home all the ti ame and can unload the photo then you may be ok i would not bank on that though if you get some pick on the camera and not on the disk then you can read the booklet that come with the camera and unload right from the camera to the disk that be much easy i think i try not to put any pick on the 8 mb on the camera but some jam i forget the memory card and then have pick there on the camera which do not show when you stick in the memory card medium card come in lot of size a far a what they hold they all look the same on the outside other than the number print i go with 64 for that and have 2 of them they hold about 125 photo which be enough around here i keep one in the camera and one in the printer most ti jam and switch out when one get full that remind me to look and see what i want to get rid of or print you would not have to buy a printer you can use the one you have if it be color do buy photo paper though so the picture will look like picture it be nice to have a printer make for photo though i get the he 1115 the nice thing here be that i can put the memory card right in the printer and then make 4 6 photo on the spot by the number of the shoot it doe not show the picture on the printer though it seem like a nice idea to have all those memory store on disk it be just not the same to have computer picture they be not a much fun to look at a hard copy one way around the printer problem be that you cannonade the pick and then unload to snakish www snakish com once you have the pick up and can look at them you can edit at of and then can order the print you want that be a little extra work but that can work out if you would not want to spring for the printer b the he 612 be not good than homemade biscuit b though i love this camera there be some thing that i do not like they be not major thing but they be part of the package the big thing for me be that digital ha law ti ame in other word you push the button and then it drag for a split second that mean that it be hard to get action shoot kiss be active so i amiss a lot i would want to capture and could capture with a 35 mm i usually carry both a pocket 35 mm and this camera and get all i want with the two camera one nice thing about digital be that you have the lead screen and can really look at the shoot before you snap but the lead be really hard to see when the sun be out i find it good to use the regular viewfinder outside when you use the lead you get a black flash up and know you take a picture when you use the viewfinder you press and do not hear a sound you will wonder if you actually take the picture i often shoot 2 or 3 think that i do not really make a picture i do not catch this until i review on the lead which work great to see what you shoot or put it up on the computer and look on the plus side i often get good pick when i have 2 or 3 shoot yes this one doe eat battery and so do all the digital camera i be use to 35 mm which will go on and on with the same battery it take me a while to learn to always carry extra this be just part of the digital camera world right now i hope that get good that cover the basis b but how about the option b this camera doe let you play around some it doe not have a many option a some but it ha a much a i would want unless i could afford the professional level digital which i can not you can push the button on the back and get the menu and make the selection and also on edit some with the photo on the spot like you can dump a bad one the book cover it we will that you get with the camera and i can use these option when i want to off center focus be the one thing i use the most i hate really flat photo and this let me make some change with good result box in on what you want to highlight push the button to take picture half way down then all the way down easy enough the room x can be nice be aware that room doe not have the same quality that standard would have it be good to walk in than to room in the various flash option be good it ha fill flash and also off flash the main one i use be the off when i do not want to light up a room the software for photo be ok the big thing be that you would not get a booklet to cover how to use that i use software at work and can guess on most of that they would have some direction that you can pull up on the computer but it be still nice to have direction to hold in your hand and look at one of my student who never use much software call the company and raise cain about that and get a free book to help her i think i will borrow that iso i do not have to guess so much b do you want to spring for this camera b if you want an easy digital camera that take good picture then i would say this one be solid you will really want to add on with the other item that do run the price up but make life easy to get the medium card and the printer i think it about double the price overall so figure on 500 to do this the battery and charge will jack it up a bite more but save you money down the road i be not go top rate on this one because i do not think digital camera have mix out yet a far a be wonderful at home i still fall back on my mmm but this he be great for what it be and what it doe if i have to pick again i would go with this one
110;Camera;have look around the web for a digital camera i wa look at either the ze or the canon eod300 rebel unfortunately the rebel wa out of my price range so i buy the ze overall i make a very good choice the camera take good picture in the majority of circumstance you can have full control over the aperture exposure and focus should you wish too the camera cannonade over some or all of the function too if you wish low light shoot be easy and there be an option for sunset preserve to keep the warmth of a picture rather than overexpose to si simulate full light fast move object need good light a you would expect but the camera can still operate at speed approach 1600 iso the speed be quote in second and fraction so you will have to convert to iso yourself if you be that way incline night shoot be an exercise in steaminess and the treat mount be online with the lens so trip be easy to attach and use with the camera the position of the trigger mean that a decent push be need often spoil the shoot through movement on the try i tend to use the ti ame delay function after line the shoot up since the exposure ti ame wa generally 2 second you would not be able to take moment in ti ame shoot anyway a you would blur however if motion blur wa want for a set ti ame then the lack of a remote may hind you the flash wa good with the red eye reduction set annoy 3 distinct flash be use rather than the usual stroke but effective the viewfinder show a full picture but it ha an obvious border so you will get more than you see the lead screen show the full picture observe by me not scientifically prove the viewfinder and lead screen be serve by the same mechanism and therefore can not be activate at the same ti ame long exposure shoot be restrict to 10 second maxim alum the senior si amply can not take long exposure i typically call long exposure at least 1 minute with traditional camera take maybe 30 minute onwards this be not a fault of the camera a most digital camera suffer the same fate of overhear end only the eod300 can have long exposure i have see a 10 minute exposure picture for a budget camera six optical room be terrific and even the autofocus at maxim alum room be quick and efficient a certain knack need to be adopt with the camera since the shutter trigger be a two position button a half press will continually focus and a full press will take the picture therefore if you si amply press the button the shutter will appear to be slow since the rouse mechanism will kick in before the picture be take if you be anticipate a fast shoot then half hold the button to activate the autofocus then the shutter can be activate quickly sign this method the come wa fruitless and fast i have never be a fan of megapixels to rate a camera rather the resolution on offer be good and true 2048 scale very we will but do not expect many per a 128mb card never mind the bundle limb colour reproduction be faithful on daylight shoot and average for even shoot with maybe a hint of overflow battery life be great on rechargeables i get 300 shoot from a set of 2100 ni be before they need charge and i wa use autofocus and room a lot however if you use alkaline then expect 200 before the battery be drain note they will not be useless good enough for remote or clock but they have lose the edge for the oris note camera need for negative point the build quality be average the mechanical shutter jam on my only 1 week into use it i could not shift between lead and viewfinder and a heavy press wa need on the back screen to release the shutter not good the battery compartment seem very fly amy and i worry about break it every ame i use it and i charge my battery in a smart charge not internally no ac supply be include but the majority of people who need one will have a regulate supply to hand anyway the lack of remote function be the only notable omission from a rather useful bargain camera

112;Camera;i buy the camera over 6 month ago and have take over 1500 picture it be a great little camera my uncle ha the sonya mavra and while it seem to have some good feature it be much big than the today i like the small form factor the download interface be easy it ha u and the picture quality especially outdoor be great i would suggest get a viewfinder on whatever digital camera you buy the today 240 model ha one the viewfinder be especially helpful when it be bright outside and you can not see the little digital screen i be part of a search and rescue team and use the camera outdoor on my search and rescue practice i ve drop it several ti jam and be pretty rough with it iso far it ha always work we will even after the fall there only 2 downside i cannothink of for the camera one be that it really suck down battery especially if you review picture on the digital screen i d suggest get more than one set of rechargeable battery a back also some jam when take picture indoors the flash cause a blue glare on the pick but this usually only happen when the room be pretty dark and the subject be more than about 5 6 foot away the follow statement add after 9 month of use camera still great but wa in the shop for over a month when it just stop work act like the battery we be dead but even after replace the battery it remain freeze and would not work my sister ha a 280 and the same thing happen to hers i would suggest purchase an extend warranty if available br br
113;Camera;i buy this because the price wa super low at 60 and the brand wa today true to it be name this today camera give very good quality picture i do not think that for home use you need more than 1 megapixel mind alum resolution need for x print be 640x480 that be about 0 3 megapixel so at 1 megapixel u can have print 2 order great home user should concentrate more on other feature now this camera feature 1 3 picture quality the low quality of 576x432 be not good enough even for x print so be useless high and high quality at 1152x864 be good the i damage size be around 300 b for high quality around 150 b for high one and around 50 b for least one so on a 16 mb compactflash card this camera house a compactflash card slot you can have around 50 best quality or around 100 good quality picture 2 this camera can be hook to any it to v find in u use a video cable that be not available anywhere except for a few webster not even today online shop ha this video cable least i could not find one the price be very low on the site it be available around 5 buck so can not think of why today do not include it in the original pack also this camera can not be hook to a pal to v find in europe and asia although it be canadian version can be doe not matter for an american buyer but be a negative for an indian like me 3 since digital room can be take only at the low resolution it be not much read that any use 4 flash can be operate in automatic on and off mode this be helpful default be auto so this be actually a point and shoot camera no set require 5 shutter speed be fix that be a low keep the camera too close and the contrast be too great most i important 6 almost everyone here mention that battery run out fast i wa very i impress with the performance of ni be cell i buy 4 pair of duracell 1800mah ni be a cell and a duracell charge for 4 a or ana cell for just 25 from rite aid so i take turn with 2 pair and with each 2 pair i get something like 50 60 photograph and i use lead mostly for take and review the picture so i think this be good performance i guess all that have give negative feedback on battery performance have deal with alkaline cell this way i do not need an ac adapt too 7 the pp conductivity be the most negative feature on this camera it us an ultra slow aerial connection even more slow on the internal memory so you have to buy a u card reader or pp card adapt for fast transfer for the picture quality u can check the page where i have keep my picture http www angelfire com weird vive the first four link lead to thumbnail page of all the picture i have take from this camera my experience use the flash option intelligently and you will get good picture in almost all situation

123;Camera;search for a digital camera can be a nightmare and i spend the last year try to find a camera with all the feature i want at a price i could afford i have have a beginner digital camera for three year now while it wa high end when i get it it be now novice level and wa begin to give up the ghost it wa ti ame to invest in a new digital camera and i know exactly which feature i want unfortunately these do not coincide with my price range until i find the toshiba per my the toshiba per my be a megapixel digital camera offer all of the feature i want for a bargain pricetag if you be shop for a digital camera i would suggest that you approach this scientifically a the vast number of offer can just overwhelm you when you start look also set out your price range what you be will to spend and what you absolutely can not go over budget wise my criterion when i wa shop include megapixel high resolution room capability x mind alum u connection strongly prefer menu drive easy to use fast process smartmedia card include strongly prefer ac cord include rechargeable battery strongly prefer all accessory include that i need total price under 400 refurbish okay if warrant after look at the feature of dozen of different brand digital camera i wa quite frankly overwhelm and more than a little confuse it wa hard enough to compare feature within a brand but compare several camera of different make and model almost i impossible there be so many different thing to consider and minor variation i finally make up my checklist above and start go through all of the option and supplier i ll describe the camera it itself then take you through my criterion and the specification of the per my step by step here b physical appearance and feature the camera ha a silver body and measure about 5 wide x 3 high x 2 8 deep and weigh only 11 3 oz without the battery or smartmedia card on the front there be the lens which protrude from the silver case an optical viewfinder and economic grip with a rubber finger rest on the top be a pop up flash shutter button and the mode dial on the back be the lead display a backlit data display room control menu display micro delete button a rocket button to navigable through the control with serf a an enter button also and the flash ti ame and i damage quality control button on the bottom be the battery compartment and the try adapt on one side be the door for the smart medium card which lock shut and on the other side be a rubberize flap that cover the u connection ac jack and it out jack meg fix high resolution this camera ha a 2 14 megapixel 1600 x 1200 or 800 x 600 resolution i generally use it in the low basic mode there be three size available and i find the 1600 x 1200 i damage to be far too huge the i damage quality even at the low set be fabulous crisp and clear b room capability this camera ha a x optical room which be equivalent to a 38 115 mm lens the room extend out when in use and retract back into the camera when not in use or the camera be turn off there be also a x digital room feature it be worth note that the lens area stick out from the rest of the camera all of the ti ame and be cover with a lens cover when not in use one fun feature be a 2 5 playback room which let you look more closely at picture in the playback mode b u connection this may be a petty point but it wa i important to me personally i have several little gizmo attach to my computer and hate kneel down try to switch out the connection for my camera on the back of my computer when i need to change to another input the u cord be great i can just leave it connect all of the ti ame and plug it into my camera to download when need b menu drive it wa i important to me to be able to see at a glance exactly what the control and set we be i want an lead display standard on most digital camera today that make it very si ample for me to set the camera and use it without a lot of squat at tiny key try to remember which combination to push together etc this camera s menu be great there be a single button clearly label menu that i push to bring up the menu from my menu i can control the record mode all set self ti ame lead set i damage quality flash mode sound ti ame language playback set etc there be also several button that accomplish some of these feature if you would not want to do this all on screen however i find it be ample and easy to just stroll through the venus and select the option i want and see them confirm on screen b easy to use in addition to be menu drive i want a camera that would not baffle me when i pick it up bear in mind that i use to sell medical equipment so i be not afraid of technical product nonetheless i like a camera i can pick up and understand in a matter of minute without spend hour read manual or have to read the manual four ti jam just to figure out how to shoot a basic picture the per my ha be outstanding in this area it be clearly set up with button clearly mark the on screen display and a mode dial on the top the mode dial allow you to select whether you want manual mode where you control the set and focus automatic autofocus off playback or pp download mode there be a decent at each option so it be easy to turn the dial to the correct set and a rubber be around the outside so it be easy to grip there be also a little status display a data lead screen right next to the optical viewfinder that be visible even when the i damage lead display screen be off this show you the battery level smart medium card state ti ame current picture set and number of picture remain i find myself refer to this all the ti ame b fast process many people forget that toshiba be a computer company and a relatively new entrance to the digital camera market their first digital camera we be purchase and relabeled with the toshiba name only with the per my do toshiba put their own electronics inside the ultra fast process speed on the my reflect this with what be call the fat consumer level digital on the planet it take about 2 second to boot up at full resolution and between 8 and 2 second between picture of course if you really need fast picture than that there be a burst mode available that give you 4 to 16 shoot per second b smart medium card include i want either a smart medium card or floppy disk capability with the medium include in my price the toshiba per my price include a 8 mb smart medium card which allow me to take up to 128 picture at the low resolution on one card there be a 9 mb internal memory however this be only for suffer the picture and there be no internal storage which surprise me but be fine now that i understand that there be also a smart medium card adapt that be optional this let you put the smart medium card right into your floppy drive ac cord and rechargeable battery one of the thing that i dislike about my previous camera the visitor vivicam 2700 see my review at http research opinion com elect review 2b65 5b6730 38922400 ride wa that it literally eat battery when the lead screen wa on it almost inhale battery even off i could rarely get more than 30 40 i damage on a four pack of battery the per my ha three answer to that dilemma first be the inclusion of a iv ac adapt so you would not have to use your battery for fix i damage shoot and playback download i have to order my adapt for the vivicam separately and it run about 40 secondly the battery be a rechargeable lithium 3 iv 1100mah lion battery pack include that let you take about 160 picture with the viewfinder on or 240 picture with the lead screen off i ve never let it run all the way down but it show about half charge at 60 80 i damage leave and i generally use the flash and the lead screen the battery charge right in the camera in about five hour if fully discharge there be an optional external battery charge that be suppose to be far fast one hour charge ti ame and for long excursion i d recommend an extra battery pack a we will finally you cannoturn the lead screen off and this will save power consumption a we will b all accessory include that i need after my experience with the vivicam i want to be sure i do not have to spend a lot of extra money after my purchase to complete my set the per my come with everything i need although there be some optional accessory i be still consider the camera ship with camera rechargeable lithium ion battery ac power adapt 8 mb smart medium card shoulder hand strap d from instruction manual warranty card aerial table it video table u cable and lens cap cover the debate form wa download from the toshiba webster extra feature i do not expect a i say this camera meet my requirement in addition there we be several other feature that we be above and beyond my requirement and of course i be thrill with them although i have not figure them all out these include lens cap cover a lens cap cover that cover the protrude lens it be attach by a strap to the camera so you would not lose it movie capability this camera ha the capability of make short video without sound this amaze me at this price the maxim alum size for any one movie be 8 mb and ti ame range from 30 120 second depend on the resolution require the i damage quality be low in move full size 320 x 240 and half size 160 x 120 pipe but it be a fun feature and great to watch black and white i damage this wa a surprise feature that i do not even realize this camera have until i read the manual i have many ti jam that i d like to get a nice black and white photo especially for corporate presentation or business use the per my ha an iso set that let you adjust the sensitivity from the equivalent of iso 100 to 200 to 400 to black and white burst multi i damage set in the burst mode you cannonade 4 to 16 photo per second these be not send to the card but be store in memory after the burst you select which one you want and store them to the smart medium card this be a nice mode for a move object or for kiss like mine who smile and run this way i can usually get at least one good picture there be another mode call multiple i damage that let you take 16 continuous shoot 4 per second all of the i damage be save a one full size i damage this be nice for move subject and my nephew use it to photograph a horse jump you can not however use a flash on burst or multi photography bulb mode this be a long exposure mode for take picture that require several second to photograph an example would be picture of firework at night you can not use the flash for this mode either you can adjust it from 1 second to 8 second open self ti ame a si ample but nice feature allow you to take picture on a ti ame you can set the ti ame for either a 2 second or 10 second delay and can make move with the ti ame a we will micro a close up mode allow the camera to focus on subject between 1 and 3 foot normally subject this close would be too close to focus on but in the micro mode i cannonade picture a close a 5 inch such a of my kiss and have them be in focus this be a really nice feature that i do not expect to find on a camera in this price range manual mode if desire you can set the camera to manual to adjust the white balance exposure compensation aperture value and of a area i have to admit that i do not know anything about these feature and strongly prefer the automatic mode but far more skilled photographer would no doubt appreciate this feature economic shape the camera be more or le mold to your hand so it be easy to grip with rubber grip and a natural right hand shape that conform to your hand it be very lightweight and i find it far easy to hold than my previous digital camera and even my fix mental camera digital room allow the center of the i damage to be enlarge to twice it be normal size so you can more clearly see the i damage you be record this be nice for take picture of object you know you may crop late but want to select clearly now playback room this be a cool feature that allow you to frame in the area of a picture you want to see then room in on that area during playback this be great for see a small piece of an i damage that you want to see up close such a a person s face in a distant shoot this be especially useful for burst photography where you be pick whether or not to save i damage or if you be near the capacity of your card and want to decide if you should save or delete an i damage 3 mode display screen the lead screen actually ha three option the first be show the i damage with all of the photographic mode symbol mode number of shoot leave flash battery ti ame date etc the second mode be to show the i damage without any symbol or mode information and the third be with the screen off the first two mode be also available during playback i have find that the information be useful for my first picture than i find it distract and turn it off additional lens capability this camera ha an adapt ring attachment on the front which be a treat ring if you want to you could attach an additional lens or optical filter to your camera red eye mode the flash can be set in several mode include automatic red eye reduction force flash suppress flash and slow synchro the slow synchro be good for shoot people at night with a dark background or where there be a lot of backlighting etc white balance in the manual mode you can set the white balance option include automatic adjustment outdoor bluish fluorescent light reddish fluorescent light and incandescent light my cousin wa quite excite to hear that i have these option although i again admit i always leave the camera set to automatic b what i be disappoint in for the most part i be thrill with this camera to be fair though there be three thing that be disappoint although i ve learn to work with them and you should be aware of when you select this camera these be shutter law there ha to be a slight law between when you hit the shutter and when you take the picture this allow the camera to focus and then take the picture if you would not allow for this law and just hit the shutter all the way your i damage may be out of focus i have learn to work with this but i must admit it be a pain when i have two little regret i be try to photograph that extra second it take to focus can make the difference between have them smile or not or in the picture or have run off already in any case you have to partially depress the button to focus before you fully depress the button to take the picture off between record amp playback whoever set the mode dial clearly wa more concern about battery conservation than convenience the camera ha to cycle past off to get from record to playback which be a pain in the rear i will admit that if you lip it really fast you can usually fool the camera i like to see the i damage i just take before i decide if i need another one so i often lip back and forth it be a minor inconvenience but not one i can not live with low light rouse problem the camera focus optical not use an inflame beam i be not sure if this wa to i improve the process speed or what but it mean that the camera ha difficulty rouse in low light situation i ve also have some minor problem with distance rouse but not a bad axis these be not horrible issue and perhaps if i have pay 800 for the camera i would be more upset but it be a minor inconvenience toshiba tell me there be a firmware upgrade available but i do not have this yet b price the toshiba per my meet all of my requirement and wa we will within my price range the retail price for a brand new per my be 799 but i have see this on sale online for 599 and up i buy mine through bid for under 400 and there be a 100 mail in debate a we will this bring my grand total to 296 include ship new or refurbish my camera wa refurbish but with a 90 day warranty which be long enough for me to determine if there be any major technical pitch with the camera i have purchase many electronic item refurbish and have find that new or refurbish the average ti ame to discover problem be about 2 3 week if they pas this ti amelie the next hardly doe not show up for over a year which generally put them outside the one year warranty anyway i have purchase coffee maker computer monitor camera and other electronic product refurbish without problem in the past or a i say the

126;Auto;i first saw what wa to become the x 300 at the philadelphia auto show in 1999 it wa then call the equal i look curiously at this large for a hyundai car sit on the platform and wa disappoint that it wa for show only you could not sit in it the next year it have change name and wa available for inspection i wa i immediately i impress with the long list of standard feature and the stick price just knock me out this year with the 0 finance i decide to take a test drive i be glad that i do it turn me on to an incredible value that i be appreciate more with each day i drive it front and side air bag traction control pre tenor seat belt they tighten to hold you against the seat in a collision and 4 wheel a disc rake make safety one of the big reason i buy this car these be standard yet some of these item be not even offer on other make in this price range the 5 speed automatic transmission be the smooth shift one i have ever have the pleasure to drive slip it into the manual gate and you can control the shift point to give a porter feel even in the manual gate however you can not overrun the engine or shift to too high a gear to make the engine drag a it be electronically block shift while cover while in d come a bite late so if you like to push it through the corner a bite you will definitely need to use the manual gate the engine it itself be extremely quiet during normal acceleration and bruise even at 70 may but exhibit a slight growl under hard acceleration not at all unpleasant though this certainly be not the fat car on the block but it be more than adequate for most driver the lip side to that be that gas mileage be pretty good for a car of this size i be average in the low to mid 20 s in suburban drive the 2002 will have a 3 5 late 194 he engine upgrade ride quality be more to the highway cruiser type hardly a pothole or bump will jar you handle be a bite bushy due to this comparable to my chrysler town country midian the complex not about the little wheel ha be rectify a the xg300 now come with standard 16 wheel michel tire i have read some of the other review here and wonder if these people have actually drive the car one complain of tight head room with the moon roof i be 6 5 and usually have trouble fit into car of asia descent this be the only one i have sit in with a moon roof that i can actually fit in with no problem my head doe not touch the roof line even with the moon roof line close leg room be adequate for me and someone can actually sit behind me in the back seat the 6 way adjustable power seat be very comfortable but lack enough lateral support for hard cover the leather be nice and smell good to me i do not know where they get the plastic fume from in fact the interior in general be we will put together the trip computer be kind of useless give mile until empty and mile drive a the only useful information i do not really care about average mile per hour or elapse ti ame and would have appreciate gas mileage read not include the mile drive be redundant with the trip odometer on the dash coli mate control be very nice keep the car either warm or cool accurately but somewhat confuse to use air can be fresh or recycle or automatically determine by computer the confuse part if fume be present i still have not quite figure out what that mean passenger seat be 4 way power adjustable and both seat be heat standard on l which with leather in a cold coli mate you really do need they get very cold to sit on the mist button on the end of the wipe stalk be a nice touch that allow one sweep of the windshield during light his note driver power seat will fully retract when the engine be turn off to allow easy entrance and exit and return to the previous set upon start the car there be 2 present for the seat and mirror available on l version this be standard electrochromic review mirror be standard automatically adjust for day night electronically i probably miss some item but the list be very long i buy the xg300l version and most everything be standard with moon roof heat seat and a long list of standard item on the l plus every option available wind shield for moon roof cargo net 8 d change and pin strip the car list for around 27 000 i pay 23 500 with 0 finance for 5 year for 660 i get the extend warranty for 10 year 100 000 mile jumper to jumper coverage usually 5 year 60 000 mile which be then also transferable to a new owner you can not come close to watch that with any other car i think it be a nice look car but that be subjective to each person and the quality seem to be there iso far i be extremely i impress the fit and finish at this point i highly recommend this car to anyone who can look beyond the prestige factor of some brand name

129;Auto;please read marsh s post yes bursa it be a truck before read this post a this post be in reply to his excellent review of the x i decide to post this a a review since it become kind of long for a comment response to his review marsh i largely agree with your post i own a 528i wagon see my review and it be a good handle and big cargo space vehicle than the x but car appeal to people emotion a often a their sensibility i drive a x with the 4 ll engine and it definitely ha emotional appeal in spade let s face it most people worry about how they will look in a car above all else especially in this market segment and the x look good also the interior be like no other that i ve see stun i agree that it be a compromise vehicle and i like the wagon more for it be extra space and good ride and handle but if i do not need the extra space we be not such a drive enthusiast and want something that say something about my position in life loudly and with flair i could do much bad than the x lastly regardless of any compromise this thing be a bow forget the i damage forget the prestige put your ego aside to me there be one reason to spend this kind of money on a vehicle because it be an incredible engineer achievement you feel it in every shift through every corner and approach every stop light you feel it when you open the door and get in and you feel it when you employ any of it be feature it be automobile genius and thus any bow be a barge not those with the mean br br
130;Camera;this camera be great for home use it work a a webcam a we will a a still can it shoot picture at 640x480 resolution and the picture be very high quality i love the cf slot the only thing be that it be max be 32 mb i use a cf card all the ti ame and cannothen take it out and insert it into my pad and view the picture anywhere i have a little trouble instal the driver on my window up machine but finally get it to work it doe have flash contrary to what the main page say the internal memory be 8 mb of ram the problem with ram be that once it lose power the data be lose but they have include a back battery so that a long a your back battery be good you can change your battery without loss of data i personally just use my compact flash card since it doe not require power to retain data and since i can view the picture on my pad
131;Camera;the hewlett pack photo smart c200 digital camera be a budget conscious wonder of engineer i wa able to unpack the camera load the battery and take picture within 10 minute crystal clear digital i damage be possible that would amaze the vocational mmm buff and the graphic delivery certainly be more than adequate and convenient for internet unload my background in conventional photography would typically find me suspicious of the range possible within the digital arena however i be encourage with the future of digital photography if hewlett pack wa able to develop such a respectable platform at such a reasonable price the purchaser should be aware of several li agitation i find that the c200 deliver the most effective result when photo be take on the quit super fine quit set the camera offer three set with progressive i improvement in the i damage accord to the number 1 2 or 3 three be optic alum the fine the set logical the le photo can be store in the memory card however this be not a large concern since the photo can be easily download and the memory card refuse digital camera suck the life out of battery so rechargeable battery and battery charge be a good secondary investment unfortunately the hpc200 doe not come with an ac adapt although one be available separately the adapt sell separately be price and fairly specific a far a it be electrical configuration so the wise consumer may want to avoid a genetic model that may damage the camera finally and at the low price point this drawback may be forgive the manual light set be awkward to manage since they be arbitrary arrow button that cause the photo to become gradually light or dark

140;Camera;when you power the camera up it take about 3 second to warm up before it be ready to shoot once it be ready you push the shutter down halfway to lock the autofocus and then depress the shutter fully now you have a pick you can review it on the lead if you want any where from 2 to 10 second the lead screen measure 1 5 inch and fairly clear and easy to see but it would have be nice to control the brightness next move inside to take some flash picture here you will use the autofocus illuminate to help the camera focus in low light there be a small orange light on the front of the camera under the flash when you focus it come on to make it easy for the camera to focus this epi minute the long focus ti jam that some other camera have in these situation if they can even focus at all also inside you will appreciate the fact that canon put a decent flash on this little guy it ha a work distance of about 13 foot at the wide angle set picture quality be very good picture come out sharp with accurate color tone i do get red eye some jam in indoor shoot but not always and not to the point that i would consider unacceptable software etc canon supply you with two software application one their own and the other be arcsoft s both application be good for basic i damage edit but if you want something more you will likely use photoshop download photo s be pretty straight forward once the software be instal hook up the computer with the supply cable to a u port lip the mode switch turn it on and your computer pp will either open the appropriate program or you will have to once the program be open pick the i damage you want and hit file transfer that be about it you can also view i damage and move on a to with the supply cable the only other thing in the box aside from the manual be a limb compact flash card and 4 a battery in the high resolution you will get 8 picture on this card so you will probably want to also purchase a six 256mb bexar online for 50 the a battery will last about 100 pick so consider purchase 30 rayovac min rechargeables also the battery and the cf card will set you back about another 80 but you will thank yourself late i would recommend these for anyone purchase a digital camera
141;Camera;i buy this camera for two reason 1 it be a today this be a respect name and i felt curtis that i would get a good product 2 it come highly recommend by a friend in the computer industry whom i highly respect arm with this knowledge and a receipt so i could return the camera if it fail to meet my expectation i just march in grab one off the shelf and buy it what i get wa far more then i expect just point and click and you have a remarkable i damage this be the most basic application from there you begin to expert agent and find that you can organize your photo user define holder there be several rouse method light and white balance be selectable or automatically control it be up to you cool bell and whistle select text and or date to appear on each photo build in audit record and playback for each photo use your camera like a video camera for your computer i e internet phone or web camera this list go on downside there a couple of problem but they seem to be inherent to the digital camera world not just to the today do series unless you buy the ac adapt you will be spend a lot of ti ame and money change battery and unless you purchase the optional parallel unload device you will be spend a lot more ti ame wait for i damage to unload via the asynchronous port the u interface be fast and good then asynchronous data transfer but the wait ti ame be still somewhat painstaking what i find best about this product though be not the bell and whistle but the quality of picture i get we be talk about fix density that my monitor could not display with the right printer i use the elson color status 850 1440x750dpi and photo quality paper you cannotruly get amaze clarity photo printout in conclusion and to sum it all up i would have to say today way to go i have have people ask me where i get my picture take and blow up to 8 5 x 11 when i tell them i do it with the today dc260 and print it out in my home office they be blow away and you will be too br br

144;Auto;where to begin i buy this car on the recommendation of a friend who ha a pretty serious love affair with vulvo car for the first 5 6 month the car wa fine but then his not chip within the first 10 month i notice di ame size his not chip on the front of the car unfortunately i do not purchase the clear coat auto bar at the ti ame of original purchase to me this wa totally unacceptable i take it to my dealer and have to argue with the service director to get it fix his not be not warrant in fact they would not fix it at first it wa only when i respond to the vulvo service survey with my dissatisfaction that they agree to fix the his not chip during my original conversation with curtis at rickenbaugh vulvo he indicate that the problem wa likely my fault ask if i follow other car too closely headlight the headlight go out about every 6 month annoy rake the car wa in for work on the rake twice within ask mile the power assist on the rake fail at ask mile not so good when you live in the mountain then the rear pad wear out at about ask mile rickenbaugh vulvo service mark or i be quote me 460 to replace the rear rake a service guy in nail where everything be twice a expensive a the real world charge me 180 and he tell me that i could drive at least another k mile on what i have vulvo make it sound like my car would be unfit for the road unless i have the rake replace i immediately check engine light the check engine light come on random during the two year that i have the car this light require me to take the car in for service twice service light the service light come on every 7 500 mile annoy last ti ame i take the car in i ask them to permanently disable the light or set it at 30 000 mile they say they could not do that which i do not really believe i mean c mon you can disable you wouldayti ame run light and your airbags but you can not disable the service light road noise sound like your drag race a mack truck when you be on the highway i take a roadtrip with a friend once and the wind and road noise on the passenger side we be so unbearable that we have to stuff pillow up against the passenger window to suffer the noise tire i need new tire way too early 25 ask mile i rotate and balance my tire religious back watch the plastic mold rear watch be suppose to be black after about 10 month it have oxidize to a cloudy gray it look bad and the button you press to open the watch wa crack i est mate in about another year it will break off completely handle in snow forget about it this car wa sell to me a a car that would perform we will in the snow i ve never get stick but i have definitely have some concern on snowy day bottom line the car wa in for service 7 ti jam in two year twice the vulvo dealer rickenbaugh vulvo in denver make a sticky smart ale comment about how the problem we be the fault of my drive his not chip i must follow too closely rake pad wear out i must brake too hard funny i never have problem like that with the previous car i ve own a hand civic for seven year and a they blaze for three year i aime a break i would not recommend this car any vulvo or rickenbaugh to my bad enemy the best part of the story be that on the last service survey i give vulvo rickenbaugh the poor rat possible and they never call me back i guess they be content to just blow off my bad experience really it no long matter i trade in this reliable and chatter car for a hand just this week
145;Auto;i purchase this car about 8 month ago and must say i be totally please with it i have a 2000 hand civic ex before but need something with 4 door and have the rear watch sell me on the specter with the rear seat fold down there be plenty of room for cargo i be not here to base the civic but i have to say that overall the kit outperform the civic easily that might be hard for some of you to believe but seriously drive a civic and then compare a specter the one thing that i impress me the most about the specter over the civic be it be ease to drive with the hand i have to rev the neck out of the car to extract any type of decent speed with the kit and the close gear ratio of the 5 sad transaxle you can drive moderate and still achieve excellent acceleration i just get tire of have to drive the civic so hard around town the way the specter candle be another strong point with a lot tune suspension and front and rear anti sway bar the specter remain compose and stable in corner the only minus i can find be the tire which just do not have enough traction and side stability for me in fairness though i have the same issue with the hand and after replace the firestone with yokohama it totally change the manner of that car and i suspect the same with the kit the rake work very we will with no fade after several hard stop my specter doe not have anti lock rake and so far i have not lock any of the wheel in hard break inside the specter be quite comfortable for this class of car the seat be so much good than the civic i use to hate to take the hand on long trip because of it be hard flat seat and the material after 6 month start wear out on the civic the seat material and fashion be definitely high quality on the kit the dashboard on the specter be attractive and easy to see all the control be easy to get to the only place that kit ski camp some seem to be the plastic door panel and the headline and carpet seem on the cheap side but hey this be a under 11 000 car one other thing to point out if you like do your own engine service be that the 1 ll engine be quite easy to work on i have change the oil and filter and do not even need a filter french to remove the old filter just reach down behind the engine and spin it off by hand everything else be pretty easy to get to a we will overall i must say that this be a great little car and a far a some of the other review have say about kit s reliability a they get old take a look on the road and see how many ford festive s and ford aspire both make by kit for ford and you may be surprise most of those car be over 10 year old and still run great i have know several people with them that say they be very happy

152;Camera;i receive this camera a a gift i already own a polaraid do 700 a nice but fairly featureless camera what i like about this camera be the feature room lens dual compact flash card short video and ti ame lapse photography and the general feel which be more like a camera than a lot of model what i dislike about the camera be 1 not have an ac adapt which be a 69 extra say what 2 the unexplainable delay in the shutter when take flash picture it be like quit click nothing happen i must not have turn it on then flash quit this make the camera almost unsuitable for anything but still life inside what i hate about the camera be that i can not get the software include for download the picture to work after several attempt i call the panasonic help line and wa flick off after a brief attempt to help me quit you should try it on another computer or call microsoft quit now which of my dozen computer should i try next i be able to download use the include adore software but since it want to save the picture in a proprietary format it be a long and tedious process to quit export quit each picture to a more standard peg format i will be get a flash card download which hopefully will solve the problem br br
153;Camera;the new hewlett pack he photosmart c200cl digital camera be a great digital camera for beginner who want a reasonably price camera and also want to be able to take great picture with it this wa my first purchase of a digital camera and to tell the truth i know nothing about what to look for in a digital camera i go to several store look at different model and after read the brochure on this camera i decide to give it a try i be certainly glad i do i be not extremely electronically incline but the instruction we be very si ample to understand and in no ti ame at all i wa take picture like a pro it ha a 1megapixel which at the ti ame i know nothing about but it just mean that your picture turn out more real and a very solid plain photo it also ha a x digital room for close up shoot and i like to take picture of wild and amass and this come in really handy to get a close up without share them away you can store up to 40 photo also and that be great when you put your picture into the computer then you can ease the one you have on the camera or you can keep some and delete the others i really like that feature a it make it fast to download your picture accord to how many you have on the camera if you be look for a digital camera i would highly recommend this one especially if you would like a great camera and an easy to use camera too br br
154;Camera;with digital camera price fall so rapidly and often it be a shame that every one doe not have one yet today ha one model do 280 that will meet the demand of nearly everyone and not draw a vacuum on your wallet what would appear to be a fair quality 35 mm camera be actually a superb digital camera the dc280 by today offer resolution of 1 760 by 1 168 or 896 by 592 pipe the i damage be extremely sharp and we will focus i wa truly i impress with the quality of shoot take both inside and outdoor while i prefer a high storage capacity i have seven kiss the mb compactflash memory card allow up to 97 standard or 12 high resolution shoot usually more than enough for my group shoot the si ample design compact class and comfortable size belief it be disability i even allow the kiss to take shoot with it the camera take the family antic on and continue to produce high quality shoot even after a few drop and pill the do 280 be load with feature many camera do not offer x optical room provide excellent detail the 1 8 inch lead screen be bright and clear enough for shoot selection in any light and there be a large number of flash option which make for super special effect include with the dc280 be adore s photodeluxe 3 1 and pagemill 3 0 software both provide easy picture edit and correction which be rarely need today also include their own special driver to allow you to upgrade your system for proper operation with the do 280 while i prefer the d or disc storage of the sonya magical the today do 280 connect to your pp via u this be a much more rapid file transfer a compare to the old aerial port of yesteryear i wish that the battery life could be a bite more stout for the do 280 i find myself force to swap battery after only 280 picture fortunately i carry extra around because of digital camera be so battery hungry the best feature be the bang for your buck the do 280 be now fetch a price of or around 350 dollar figure in the cost of film and process and you will pay for the camera in a year and i do not think that you can get a good quality camera on the market for a price this low not yet anyway
155;Auto;i buy a 1998 pontiac suffice and have nothing but trouble let me explain note engineer just do not seem to be there on the exterior the hood look to be open all of the ti ame the moorhof rattle lean and jam the lascar door do not line up with the rest of the quarter panel and that isunfire spoil have not they cancel that yet on the interior thing we be not much good the driver side sun vigor can not be put down all the way without nearly remove the rear view mirror the drink holder can not hold the ever so common 20 oz bottle for that matter the drink holder can not hold any drink if the car automatic be in park i would recommend people steer clear of this car it may be a bright color and look sleek but it be a mound of trouble in this case you will get what you pay for
156;Camera;i be not new to digital camera and in a way i feel good equip to explore the feature of this camera now that i ve use another one extensively let me state right off the bat that if you be not will to give the manual a fair perusal then this be probably not go to be a good camera for you my entry into the world of digital camera come through an agra e780 camera while this wa an excellent introductory camera it lack room capability and the picture quality peak out at 3 x 5 photo i love my little agra do not get me wrong it be just that i feel i have grow up now and i want a toy with more bell and whistle the polypus d 490 wa the perfect next step for me one of the reason i choose this camera over others wa the price to feature ratio in my opinion the polypus d 490 offer feature comparable to some of the high end camera without the high end price tag feature highlight not an all inclusive list b 1 8 inch color lead monitor the monitor on this camera be very sharp the display be crystal clear and it be very easy to determine if you have get the shoot you want while most digital camera have an lead screen these day not all screen be create equal the clarity on this one be one of the good one i ve see b 2 11 megapixel cod for photo quality output the high megapixel allow for large high resolution picture i have take a couple of really nice landscape shoot print them at 8 x 10 on my inject printer frame them and hang them on the wall i be exceptionally please with the quality even up close there be very little almost none graininess to be see b x optical room with 2 x digital room this be one of the main feature for which i buy the camera the x optical room be perfect for shoot in on the squirrel in the yard or move out to take in the big picture i have not use the digital room much a it require twitch from the optical viewer to the lead i just do not care to take picture that way and i find that extra step not worth the effort the picture quality degrade only slightly when use the digital room so it be handy to have when you need it but for the most part the optical room be really quite adequate b sequential shoot capability this be a fun feature that allow you take a series of quick picture without wait for the camera to write them to the memory card i have not use this feature much but it be pretty good for photographic and active child or pet out of the series you be bind to get one good shoot b manual iso set be an extreme amateur this be not a feature that i ve play with much i do understand the different iso set auto 100 200 and 400 but i have not find any reason to want to switch from auto since the camera seem very adept at determine available light and adjust appropriately quickly meet movie mode this be one of my favorite feature while still be super there be nothing more fun than be able to send a short film to grand show the indie blow bubble or fall in the snow the manual say that the camera be capable of fill up to 15 second on the include mb memory card but i often find that a 6 or 7 second video be all i really want to capture a moment b self ti ame with 12 second delay this be another feature i do not use often but i have use it and it be handy at ti jam when i decide to come out from behind the shutter i really prefer to be behind the scene document everything but once in awhile i set the camera on top of the to and jump in the picture another pro in my opinion that seem to be con with others be the fact that this camera us the aerial port for connection to the computer i know u be fast a u cable be available for this camera but doe not come with it from now until 5 31 01 polypus be offer a u smartmedia reader for free with proof of purchase however i have an old pp and it do not come with u capability i do not have a u port i know i could upgrade and i probably will someday but i do not care to be force into it this camera come with a aerial port cable that plug into the camera for picture transfer it be slow but it work and i be content with it the camera come with an mb smartmedia card and long last lithium battery the battery be great but i wish they we be rechargeable i have more in the wing though that be the mb smartmedia card be okay but not great i have two other mb card though so i can generally get all the picture i want on a day s out i d need more though if i we be go to be out where i could not download of course there be always the option to use a less resolution but that would defeat the purpose of have a megapixel camera in the first place overall my favorite part about this camera be the handle an hour with the manual greatly i approve my ability to manipulate the feature and navigable through the venus the menu option vary depend on whether the camera be off or on and i still get confuse some jam when look for a specific option i would not recommend this camera to a digital beginner i think it would be dance and frustration my husband a digital beginner would concur i love it though and it make me feel like get out and take picture this camera be ready to use right out of the box but until you have read the manual you will miss a lot that this camera ha to offer b how it compare back to my little agra 1 be a 1 megapixel camera the agra have a high yield on the mb card this 2 megapixel tiger eat up medium space naturally 2 the flash wa slow to warm up on the agra this flash be ready to use the moment you open the flash house which ha to be do mentally 3 the agra have a fix focus and fix iso set great for general purpose use but i do enjoy the flexibility of the auto iso and room capability of the polypus 4 both camera offer aerial port connection with optional s video port for to display no change there 5 the agra shut it itself off eventually once it sense it wa be ignore the polypus ha that capability but you would not realize it until you get into the software to set the camera set it even ha variable set good feature 6 the optical viewer on the agra wa center on the body this cause you to place your nose print prominently on the lead screen ugly smear the polypus be offset to the leave and be much clean to use 7 the polypus also offer and adjustment on the optical viewer to good align the view with the lens in case you keep cut uncle harold s head off overall i be proud to have trade up to my polypus i be thoroughly please with camera a a whole and my only objection wa the size of smartmedia card they choose to send with it compare to the mb card that come with the agra though i suppose i be not too disappoint a final note others have complain about the way the camera close and turn off in order to close the camera you have to slide the lens door toward the lens almost but not quite touch the lens will then retract and you can finish close the door it be a little awkward at first but it be really not a bad a all that however my husband who work second shift do wake me up in the middle of the night the first night we have the camera he have open it but could not figure out how to close it i feel like i be probably forget something major this camera be so feature pack and versatile that it be i impossible to cover everything here that be why they enclose a 140 page manual while it might not be the choice of the pro and it might be a bite challenge to the beginner be it certainly ample camera for this intermediate level user i love it and i be proud to have it for example of some of the pick take with this camera go to http community webshots com user doran the three album contain only picture take since i get this little number let me know what you think and thank for read please rate this article and if it ha help you leave me a comment

160;Auto;before i get into my review of my 1994 chevrolet gastro i feel the need to say that i love this van in all seriousness it ha probably be the smart purchase of my life it ha faithfully serve myself and my four boy for seven year and over 160 000 mile and continue to give me everything i ask for in a car with the same quality it do when it roll off the dealer s lot i purchase the van in late 1994 a a dealer close at a rock bottom price for the premium it luxury pour model on the extend body and all wheel drive it wa mine for about 24 000 a little bite expensive but when i look down the street at the dodge grand caravan a more car like and more stylish model i find that for a premium try be comparable equipment with all wheel drive the stick run we will over 30 000 it seem like a no trainer to me what the smart deal wa i give up the more car like temperament of the grand caravan but keep 6000 in my pocket although it be not a stylish look a the chrysler build minivan it be strength lie in other area one of these such area be the powertrain 4 3 liner of high output v 6 engine serve up 200 horsepower and over 250 pound foot of true this translate into smooth around town acceleration a we will a easy highway merge and two lane pass the four speed automatic transmission with overdrive be a perfect match for the engine with it be crisp shift and an overdrive gear for quiet highway bruise the fabulous all wheel drive system ha never leave me strange in snow sleep and ice and provide a notable advantage in handle and balance on dry road the gastro be a body on frame van which mean that it be bodywork be bolt to a full steel ladder frame this be good for owe do not ask me why but i do know that the gastro be rate to pull over 5000 le compare that to a maxim alum of 3 800 le for chrysler minivan the exceptionally spacious interior be also we will suit to highway bruise with it be comfortable seat especially with it try be standard seat be two front captain s chair power on the driver s side with adjustable lumbar support and headdress my particular van come with second and third row split fold bench seat that have fold center arrest and outward headdress although they be a little on the heavy side these bench seat be easily removable to open up 170 cubic foot of cargo space the one thing i can not emphasize enough be the disability of this midian 160 000 mile late and with only normal periodic his notenance it still function a it do the day i buy it the body be in perfect condition i only wash it about twice a month and wax it about twice a year and the his not still ha a glossy shine to it the interior ha take the abuse my four boy and i have wish out to it in stride the scotchgard treat cloth seat and carpet resist stain surprisingly we will and the seat cloth show no wear spot the suspension ha never need any repair save for one set of leaf spring consider the amount of load and owe i do this be nothing short of a miracle and still provide a comfortable ride the engine start up with absolutely no he imitation even on a below zero morning run smoothly quietly and without complex not and most i importantly ha never fail me something i can not say about my 1995 voyage read my review and you will know what i be talk about however even i have to admit that this van ha it be pitfall nothing in life come without a price and the price that come with this van be the louse gas mileage i have consistently average between 16 and 17 pg with this vehicle this be no doubt attributable to the large displacement for a v 6 truck engine and the all wheel drive system the control panel also leaf a lot to be desire the first generation instrument panel of the gastro place coli mate control to the i immediate right of the gauge cluster which curiously include a voltmeter and oil pressure gauge but not a tachometer and the sound system in the dead center of the dashboard this be inconvenient for two reason 1 the front passenger can not comfortably reach the coli mate control and 2 the driver can not comfortably reach the sound system in 1996 chevrolet update the gastro to include a new dashboard layout which feature easy to use rotary coli mate control knob and new delay sound system the final downfall of this vehicle be the substandard crash test score nut rate the 1994 gastro a three star average for the driver and one star very poor for the front passenger in their front i impact test the insurance institute for highway safety also deal the gastro a sicken blow with it be 1996 40 may offset crash test which produce extremely poor result to see the result of this test visit the follow curl http www hwysafety org vehicle rat ce html 96024 htm although this test wa conduct on a dual arbat equip gastro the offset crash test be more demand on the structure of the car rather than the restrain not system so the result of the 1996 test be largely applicable to early model the lack of a front passenger arbat a standard feature on grand caravan and town country certainly do not help this along at all a passenger arbat wa add in 1996 along with the aforementioned design dashboard a i have never be in an accident with this van knock on wood here however i can not fat to the real world crashworthiness of this vehicle prospective buyer should note however that grand caravan receive four star enough to earn a good rat for both the driver and front passenger in 1994 regardless of the vehicle s flaw it ha do a commendable job of transport my family and i see no sign of it cease to operate anti ame in the near future when it doe however i ll be back at my they dealer look for a new gastro i recently drive my friend s 02 gastro it and i notice all the positive attribute of my workhouse a we will a some new feature i would enjoy a a final word i think it go without say that this van ha certainly live up to my expectation and i would certainly recommend it to anyone search

165;Camera;i recently receive the today dc215 a an early christmas gift so i can not complain a a buyer a i do not actually pay for it i know that in atlanta the go retail rate in the store be still cover around 299 for this camera but the person who purchase it for me find it at of all place wa mary at 249 after have use this camera a bite long i ve edit my opinion a see below for the good bad and miss edit opinion 12 10 00 it be long take a deep breath b the good b the today do 215 be in fact ha a very solid feel to it due to it be metal body a nice change compare to today s mostly plastic body on other digital camera cost even more it ha a nice feel to it and a si ample quit square be quit body with a rubber grip on the end for hold comfort the lead display be on top of the camera and be easily readable with four button to the right the large be the shutter photo button and three small button to control flash set micro close up mode and a self ti ame on the back be the color viewer power room control set control and selection button all be very intuition and easy to figure out even without the manual the color viewer be slightly recess unlike many camera where it stick out from the camera body make it hard to scratch there be also an optical viewfinder you may use to conserve matter life color viewer take a lot of battery power from your camera which be locate up and to the leave of the color viewer nice you will not leave nose print on the color view screen it g it a quick note the documentation for the do 215 be also excellent especially for beginner a clearly and easy to read manual be include and even my roommate a teno probe could understand it it be nice to find an optical room on a camera of this price range instead of a le detail digital room still if you be new to digital camera you should note that a x optical room be only equal to a slightly close than quit real vision view quit in other word x be not technically a quit room quit x and above be truly quit room quit that get you noticeably close to the object s to be photographer than your normal vision would see still again a x optical be nice for this price range photo quality be a mix bag depend on the environment i ve find that indoor photo with the flash and without during day hour with natural sunlight in the room turn out pretty nice overall the flash doe tend to flatten out color slightly but not enough to make the photo turn out horrible for the most part color be rich and detail be pretty good the various quality set talk about below more allow you to adjust the camera for good quality indoor photo a we will with a great range of quality set than find on some other camera b the bad b outdoor photo be somewhat more of a disappointment with the do 215 outside photo be fine when your subject be within 12 15 foot of you however the do 215 s fix focus lens be not able to capture great detail on distant object such a landscape mountain tree etc only an auto focus lens find on other camera usually cost more will provide that detail in other word the do 215 be great for casual photo of the pet kiss or get together but i might not pick it for those cherish scene shop of your vacation in europe if you be lucky enough to get quit his not shop pro 7 quit then you will find that you can increase the i damage quality of many of your photo however my large disappointment with the do 215 be the very fly amy door that you lip open in order to retrieve the compact flash storage card i feel this be go to be the first part of the camera to break for many folk especially if you be a guy with big finger the small button you must wife up and push in in order to erect the flash card be equally frail i ll take point off for these two feature today should have do a good quality job on these part b miss b the standard silver do 215 edition camera come with a 4 meg compact flash card this may or may not allow you to store a lot of photo depend on your set so you may wish to invest in another large storage card for example if you wish to print your photo then you will want to set your camera for quit best quit resolution 1154 x 864 fix size and quit best quit quality which will then only allow you to save about 13 photo if however you be only go to email your photo you may be able to set the camera for quit standard quit resolution 640 x 480 fix size and quit good quit quality which then allow you to save up to around 59 photo the high the quality set the le quit maggie quit and blur quit artifice quit object you will see in your photo but the le photo you can store on the card i settle for a standard physical size of 640x480 and best quality which be the clear quality set so i get approve lately 28 photo per 4 meg card sound confuse but you will get the hang of it soon enough the manual be very clearly write to help you understand if you be a heavy photo take invest a many will say here in rechargeable battery i recently purchase a set of 4 nickel metal hydrate maxwell brand battery at circuit city with the charge for under 30 and they work we will with this camera and add to the amount of ti ame you can use it rat and sample photo i ll give this camera a good rat for the casual photo take layer real estate and insurance folk and those who like to make small casual print a we will a those who like to email pick of the kiss and pet to the grand folk a i say before if you be want a camera to take 5 star quality scene or vacation photo i d look for one of the polypus band like the 460 490 or 3030 model number for that kind of quality the do 215 be worth the investment for it be ease of use and adequate photo quality for the price if you would like to see some sample pick i ve take with the do 215 a we will a an polypus and a couple of old camera please feel free to visit my yakov photo page at http photo yakov com greg30127 happy photo take br br
166;Camera;i just buy this camera a week ago and the early return on it be good today have a nice quick start guide poster that get you go i immediately take me about 20 minute to take some picture and transfer them to my pp that be include go through some of the basic menu function set like meet shoot use the x room the color be truly something vagrant and clear this be a great start camera my main use be for e mail and store photo on my hard drive i think of go the more expensive route but after read favorable review for this camera i wa sell i pay 170 plus there be a 30 debate under 150 be a steal why pay over 300 for 2 3 megapixel camera now if and when i decide to upgrade in a year or so the price of the high fix camera will probably be under 300 yes the 2 mb of internal memory be low and there be no u support that can be remedied w the picture card reader 30 and flash card memory 40 50 for 32 mb no lens cap include but one can be obtain free from today upon request which i do when i register the camera at their webster if you be look for a camera for e mail and personal use this be more than adequate besides for e mail it be really good to send photo with a low fix count 2 megapixels or more be overall another small feature i like be that it us a battery which in the long run can be much cheap than specific camera battery you can use regular alkaline or the new nickel metal aside rechargeables
167;Auto;american travel in europe for the first ti ame often have a moment of culture shock when they hail a taxi and a precede e class or bow 5 series pull up to the curb in america these car have be icon of intelligence and success for more than a generation in their holland they be more likely to be diese low tax design for disability and low operate cost than multi mate drive machine breed for the autobahn in the late 80 s ford try to beat the german at their own game in 1986 they have bet the company on the groundbreaking turn if you we be not there it be almost i impossible to i imagine the i impact this car have on the american auto industry it be say wa a cut edge a any european sedan of the ti ame and it have much more of a european feel than any american sedan make before it could not compete against the european sedan sell here but ford wonder if the german could make a taxi into a world class sport sedan could they would it with a car that have will note heart of conservative middle america that wa the challenge that face the turn she throughout it be eleven year production run it wa by any objective standard a worthy competitor to the midwife entry from bow and precede one with a distinctive american accent but in the end not enough buyer could make the mental leap that this turn wa different than the one their parent have trade in their fairmont or caprice classic for b overview and drive i impression b there we be three generation of the she the first 1989 1991 wa the original 86 quit jellybean quit turn platform with the she v 6 and suspension component upgrade the final version 1996 1999 use the all new quit oval quit turn platform and carry an equally new v 8 but i do not recommend either the first generation she wa a great engine hat to a class that wa not intend for it while the third become so refine it lose much of the distinctive personality in the early version the sweet spot wa the 1992 1995 second generation car in 1992 all taurida we be design and the she receive distinctive front and rear say that give it a whisper strong look than the first edition under the skin several weakness and customer complex not have be address and the entire platform wa strengthen give the she handle ability that come close to watch the german than any american sedan that come before and in 1993 it finally get the automatic transmission the unit say it need to win over american buyer the heart of the she wa it be engine omaha wa originally hire to design a new cylinder head for the 3 0 late ford v 6 the head they come up with produce too much power for the ford block to live with so ford contract them to come up with an entire powerplant their answer wa a dual overhead can 24 valve v 6 that only share a three late displacement with the engine in less turn model the engine wa a marvel with 220 horsepower available the she wa the most powerful engine in it be class by a slip be margin but it weigh 400 pound le than the mere and 500 pound le than the bow this make the turn she the quick car in it be class more i important than the number wa how different the three car felt in action the precede from it be engine to how the astray door close with a solid but velvet smooth action felt literally like a bank vault on wheel the bow reek of refinement by driver extremely capable yet never feel like it would lose it be composure both we be outstanding car with clear personality but neither in my book compare to the shoot of tutuila and a big slap on the back feel of the she when you get into the gas in the ford the engine growl the sneer wheel tug slightly in your hand then the growl become a roar a the tachometer needle swing quickly towards 7 000 rum it wa not crude in capable hand the she wa a remarkably compose car to drive at speed with little body roll and crisp response the she wa si amply specie and more engage than the german one of the big reason to choose a second generation car over a first be the shift mechanism for the five speed transaxle first gen she s use a cable actuate shift that have all the feel of stir a pot of warm molasses start in 92 all five speed she s pitch the spaghetti wire for solid lineage that greatly i approve the feel but it wa still notably le precise than the action on the rear wheel drive bow with it be superb five speed all front wheel drive car share this handicap compare to a good rear wheel drive set true steer another bane of powerful front wheel drive car could tug the wheel in your hand but you really have to be hamfisted with the throttle to have it effect your drive a i mention early in 1993 the she get the slushbox automatic the critic say the market want the think wa a only a relative few bow s come to america with manual gearbox and precede do not offer them on any model in the e class to compete the she need an automatic even if the purity have a fit over it the critic we be half right the automatic do not make the she a bestseller but it do i improve the feel of drive the car this be just my personal preference but in a midsized or large sedan i prefer an automatic if it be do right hustle a small light sport car up a road and snap through shift be one of life s great joy but a 3 000 pound sedan be more enjoyable when the strategy be smoothness and forethought and a good automatic be good partner to this style of drive in the she it wa no contest in my book the automatic wa a good automatic than the manual wa manual hut while the manual wa i approve in 92 it still have an i precision that hind find a gear instinctively the automatic wa good hat to the she with crisp smooth uplift that match the sport personality of the car and the effect of true steer wa greatly reduce compare to the manual unless you be the kind of enthusiast who can not have any sport car with an automatic the auto be a good way to go if the turn wa a bargain bow a review and fan call it it hide the try arm corner we will i do not know how ford make a di ame on them i prop new car and do try be not repair at a large ford dealer in 92 94 and quickly notice that a load out turn ll wa only a couple of thousand dollar le than a she fully equip with leather excellent power sport seat full power accessory power glass moorhof premium bl sound d and the automatic the stick come in at le than 25 000 the e 320 and 530i weigh in at almost twice that fifty large in the same try be it be the great price disparity between si similar car that i ve ever see b reliability and his notenance b against all bet when it wa in production the second generation she ha prove it itself a remarkably unable car only three big dollar problem area have be uncover on the second generation car she s drive in the snowbelt during winter have be know to develop corrosive in the engine suffrage it be not a fatal problem the suffrage can be replace for a few hundred dollar include labor the front rake be another consistent source of trouble the second generation car we be slightly good but ford si amply put rostov on the car that we be too small to stand up to the punishment of a high performance sport sedan the rostov get too hot and warp when use hard and like most car make in the last decade ford only include enough metal on the them to have them machine and try once maybe if you we be lucky and catch it soon enough finally for all the initial concern about funnel 200 lb ft of true through a front wheel drive transaxle the only weak link ha be the clutch in the manual transmission model the brake and clutch problem can be cure with the right application of high performance part and the engine suffrage be a job that should be good for several year all in all not a bad list of quit major quit problem area for a high performance car and by contrast the second generation base turn model have earn a lemon reputation for blow head casket in their 3 8 late engine and eat their and e transaxles the she model share no engine part with the base model and use specially modify transmission that have prove very unable can anyone think of another high performance engine transmission that be more reliable than the base model one problem area that be not unique to the she but need to be mention be the i importance of keep the thermostat and paralytic convert in good condition if the thermostat stick open the engine will not overhead but something just a bad can happen all fuel inject engine use the engine temperature a one of the major factor to determine the air fuel mixture if the engine be run too cold a it will when the thermostat be stick open the mixture will be too rich but instead of this unburned fuel vapor pour out the tailpipe and create so it be unite and burn in the cat which get much other than it wa design to be and begin to break apart inside it be not a problem until you lift off the gas from a high engine speed like when get off the freely when you would this the inflow through the engine revers momentarily and because the cat on the she be mount close to the engine if there be any debris in the cat it can be suck back into the engine it be just a destructive a pour metal shave in the intake all four area should be check out before buy a she the omaha engine ha prove to be a tough a granite aside from possible valve guide wear in hard drive car there have not be any major problem with the engine at all look for a little blue smoke at a cold start hard start or oil consumption great than a quart every 700 mile like most of their motorcycle engine the she doe not have hydraulic valve adductor so the clearance ha to be set by a mechanic but unlike a bike it be not a regular occurrence ford specify a major service between 60 000 and 100 000 mile that include a valve adjustment and replace the engine ti among belt spark plug wire and control arm push it be a major bill but nothing compare to the expense of failure if something like the ti among belt let go and this service on the she will cost a fraction of the same service expense on a bow or precede a the mile reach this territory one note the she like any vehicle with an all aluminium engine should have the cool system flush and replace every year other problem fall into the nitric category in look through the newsgroup board i wa pleasantly surprise to see that most of the problem owner be report after five year be the same one i saw when the car we be still under warranty most involve interior try be part be my relief confuse while the lumbar support leak and the wipe control on the turn signal stalk fail too soon be evidence that there we be some area where ford miss the mark in design and manufacture after five to seven year i expect to see new problem emerge a the car pile up the mile and that hasn t be the case the good news be the owner group have develop expensive solution for all the interior problem if you have a little mechanical ability with one exception if you notice the driver seat rock when you sit down or move the only fix be replace the power mechanism a bracket with the adjust motor and ray that move the seat it be not a safety hazard the seat be still firmly attach to the floor but if you want to repair it plan on lay out about 300 for a new power mechanism prick and owner support b the discovery of the enthusiast and aftermarket support on the web for the she ha be another pleasant surprise there be regional she owner club across america and a strong aftermarket for replacement and high performance part note to gearheads the level of aftermarket support for the v 6 she be a good a you will find for a camera or mustn at extremely unfordable price for this class too along with continue part support from ford the she be one of the rare li unite edition model that hasn t become an orphan in retirement but it doe remain one of the best value in the entire automobile market the belly blue book quote a 10 200 retail price for a 95 she automatic with 75 000 mile in my area like when it wa new that be almost exactly half the blue book for a 530i or e 320 but in my area that would buy you an i immaculate car in the last year i ve see close to a dozen very clean 92 95 she s with price in the 7 000 range and because most she buyer we be not testosterone poison young adult read camera mustn market the chance of find a we will his notice and care for car be very good b conclusion b a she ha be on my list of car to have since i work on them at earnhardt ford it be a terrific sport sedan at an econobox price that ha hold up remarkably we will and the mad scientist in me still get an evil grin when i think about the thing i want to do with it and that wa when i only i imagine strip all the power amenity and lose a quick 60 70 pound just on the interior now i can get supercharger that make up to 400 horsepower i bottom line a an entertain and unique sport sedan to be appreciate for what ford create or a the platform for a midwife crisis the she be i impossible to beat it wa one of the most easily overlook car when it wa new and today it ha become a hide treasure for enthusiast and if a i hammer owner scout a they be will not to do just ask how he like his taxi brian go i the source for everything you ever want to know about the she and one of the best auto fan site i ve see on the web be shoot jam com this be an indispensable resource for she owner all of the do cheap fix i mention in pass be there along with an excellent reference on troubleshoot literally dozen of different condition and great how to instruction for his notenance this may be hazardous to your wealth but shoshop com be a wonderful and highly recommend source for replacement and aftermarket she part excellent stuff at reasonable

169;Auto;now i be so far very i impress with this vehicle while it only ha about 900 mile on it now it ha prove it itself to be quite capable in any situation i have encounter with it it be the two door two wheel drive version which be the light it ha what i consider excellent acceleration for an sun leave behind my father s 1994 f150 and my mother 1999 suburban easily in some informal starlight race it ha hold it be own against those annoy hand civics with the exhaust body kit and ugly graphic all over them it ha prove to be easy to drive in wet condition easily a we will and the four wheel antilock disc rake do a wonderful job of stop you even if you fishtail in this truck it be easy to bring back under control it doe not exhibit very much body roll when go through turn in large part due to the huge sway bar under the front end it look like it be about two inch around and it doe it be job very we will the suspension be very tight for a truck it ride a little bump but because of this it candle very we will it even ha felstein shock in the back i originally want a leather interior but much to my disappointment it only come with cloth in the two door model however after live with the cloth for a couple of week i have decide that it be more comfortable my mon ha leather in her suburban and it be not a comfortable a my cloth be the seat be firm and have le side blister if you have the leather seat i get every option that you could get except for a owe package and this make it a very nice ride the audit system be very good for a factory system and come complete with 6 speaker i also have the sneer wheel mount audit control when i get them i do not think i would ever use them but now i find that i rarely touch the sterno in the dash other than to change d s i have the overhead console that tell such thing a average speed pg instant pg range amount of gas use etc this be rather interest but i usually only use it to find out the temperature and my average pg speak of pg this thing drink gas my previous car wa a tooth carry and i wa use to get at the bad around 18 pg and that wa with my foot to the floor constantly now if i drive ultra conservative i might be able to get 17 pg in the city usually it be more like 15 in the city and 21 on the highway though while the engine drink gas it doe put it to good use put your foot to the floor and you be reward with ve like acceleration while i do have the light model they make and that help this engine make a lot of true and decent horsepower and be more than adequate for any drive situation however if you look at the size of the engine i think there be quite a bite of power leave in it and i plan on upbraid to k n cold air induction free flow exhaust and a jet chip control module to pick up some more power one of the cool feature of this truck be the ability for everything to fold flat from the tailgate to the front seat you just lift one handle and shove and the back seat both fold flat with the near automatically slip themselves up it be rather nice and allow you to easily haul large object the tow rat of the truck be 5700 le and this be more than adequate for most thing include our family boat i have not bow anything with it yet i do not get the optional frame mount pitch but i know it would do a good job finally my favorite feature of the car be the excellent four wheel disc rake with antilock on all 4 wheel these thing stop you quick and the floor mount gear elector i be use to drive a car so it make it very easy for me to transition and i like it good than a column mount shift anyway in short i think anyone look for an sun that can fit into small space easily be not very large but ha adequate room inside with plenty of power to spare should purchase a blaze i be glad i do
170;Auto;i ve have my avalanche for 7 month now the more i drive it the le likely i be to drive anything else i have the ze with 2 wheel drive and the 5 7 late ve it come with a one year subscription to star leather seat heavy duty floor mat be be d player amaze electric seat with theater build in computerize control for everything include oil change interval i love the appearance of my truck there be never a shortage of people who want a ride in it it ride like a cloud down the highway there be storage compartment on each side of the truck bed with plenty of room for average people although these probably be not suitable for contractor the bed cover do keep the bed dry and the bed line ha anti say characteristic that do keep thing from slide around back there i have even have a couple of occasion to take mine off road and it handle very we will even though it only ha two wheel drive the interior be comfortable and room it will carry 5 adult comfortably it also ha enough storage that i carry way too much stuff around with me i wa concern about reliability and order the 70 000 mile warranty so far at 26 000 mile i ve not have any occasion to use the warranty a word about star i buy my truck new and the star feature which require a subscription come with one year for free i understand that there be various level of service you can get i will renew my basic subscription i ve lock my key in the truck twice and star wa able to clock the truck in both instance within 5 minute with only a short phone call this feature ha a panic button that will automatically dispatch emergency service if you ever need it and star cannotrack the location of your vehicle if it be steal i never think i d own a vehicle with all the feature this one ha i absolutely love mine i will share a few of the thing that i wish we be different please do not misconstrue this short list the benefit of this vehicle far outweigh these minor obstacle first while the bed cover do keep thing dry and add to the overall appearance of the vehicle they be inconvenient to remove and store there be a big canvas bag that you can store them in but when in storage they take up a fair amount of space in the bed assume you take them off to carry something in the bed you will be a little disappoint in the amount of room back there second this vehicle doe not have a lot of excess power i have find it adequate in all way but you can not punch it and get the same acceleration you will find on light trunk overall i be a very satisfy driver of a 2002 they avalanche if you be look for a feature lade very comfortable vehicle with class and style i highly recommend it

180;Camera;i choose the today do 210 over a couple of others for several reason 1 it us expensive battery 4 wa 2 it us a flashcard which can be read by a u reader 3 it look like a normal camera from the front 4 the price wa good than many other camera i have do photography professionally in the past and so when i begin look for a digital camera i want something that wa in my price range and yet would give me reasonably high quality photo once i actually get the camera in my hand i wa i impress the actual size of the picture at the high resolution be huge in addition by use the basic software i discover that i could get pretty incredible enlargement in fact i have find that for web application i have to reduce the low resolution size even more for it to unload and download quickly my particular camera come with additional software adore photodeluxe 2 0 and pagemill 2 0 these application be helpful and pretty si ample to use overall i have really enjoy and appreciate the ease and quality of this camera in truth the only real grape that i have be pretty minor 1 you have to save the picture into a different format to use them in any program other than the today program 2 the camera be somewhat heavy for it be size make long shoot without a try a little difficult 3 the power button be a little to close to the shutter button last of all you need to decide before you purchase a camera what exactly you need in the camera and what you can live with then look long and hard at all of the one currently on the market do not just run out to get a camera because someone else ha one check out opinion and ask around about each camera you be interest in remember that an expensive camera that doe not do what you need or want be pretty worthless above all have fun with your camera
181;Camera;a a person who never get around to develop film i think a digital camera would be a great thing to have i find this little guy at palmar for under 200 00 and wa i impress with what feature it ha the resolution compare with much more expensive camera in fact the only other camera in this price range we be only 640x480 or le the result be clear and crisp and if print on photo paper look just a good print the only downside be the lack of a manual on screen help be worthless if you be not take picture in the house and the icon on the camera s menu be not really user friendly the color lead screen be bright and sharp except for outside in strong light and the picture review be handy you can delete a shoot instantly if it doe not look right and free up the memory for another picture you can also hook this to your to or v with the provide cable and review picture save them on tape or even use the camera a a low quality can order if you would not mind fill all the action within a 5 radius of the v due to cord length also handy be the separate black and white lead on the top of the camera it ha a battery level indicator display what resolution your picture be in fine very fine and normal and how many shoot be leave in each mode the high the quality the le shoot the memory will hold on the main menu access on the color screen you can set the quality to ga or va ga be the best so you end up have access to 6 different film quality set with ga very fine be the best and va normal be the low quality but still very adequate the flash mode indicator be also on the top lead off on and auto even inside you would not need to use the flash very often due to the fact that you can also choose the available light level on the main menu sunlight lamp light etc the indoor shoot i do use the flash on come out overexpose until i turn the flash completely off then they we be perfect i d recommend this for anyone that want a digital camera but doe not need all the high end option on more expensive model br br
182;Camera;i wa look for a digital camera for quite some ti ame i want one that wa easy to carry and care for would fit compactly into my brief bag and would be price properly to make it worth my while to use and send digital i damage over the internet one day i enter my need specification into a webster to search for that camera and only one result it wa the pdc640 by polaroid corporation i find one and buy it i have use this camera almost daily for approve lately 5 month now i take some jam up to 10 six a day x 5 day a week with the program provide i can quickly download these picture and send them on their way with my fix report i be a reactor and i use my camera for business it ha not fail my and for the under 300 price it fit perfectly into my expense structure it beat develop a partial film scan to a disk then e fail it i save a bunch br br
183;Camera;the exterior of the camera be very nice sleek look and professional it be portable and light fit easily in a pocket a plus for the weekend photographer unfortunately be a mother of three a camera at the ready be a necessity this particular tool take a few second to set the ideal shoot option and if it visit idle for only a short ti ame it automatically shut off which be a plus a far a battery preservation but force you to have to go through the process of turn the camera on and pick the shoot option again before actually take the picture this can be frustration when take picture of kiss who be always on the go i have also find that there be a problem with quality picture and there seem to be a toss up a to whether the picture will turn out clear or flurry i have find it take clear picture more consistently outdoor than in and if the light be ideal it doe hold up to 70 picture and ha a very bright flash which help with some of the flurry indoor picture a bite the camera doe double a a web can which i find be ideal it come with a photo program arcsoft photo i impression that be si ample to use allow you to not only view and alter picture that you have take away from the computer but also shoot live video and give you the opportunity if your computer and video card allow to make move with the vi maker it only take 2 a battery which last a long ti ame thank to the battery save feature that shut off the camera when it be idle for a short period of ti ame it connect to the computer by u port i have to replace the port after a small household accident on my part when i go to replace it i find that both end of the cable we be identical which pose a problem i end up have to go to a computer specific store to find the correct cable to replace the one i break
184;Camera;quick update december 2003 about 3 500 photo on and it be still go strong it be not have a rough life but i take it everywhere i go and ha be drop a few ti jam onto carpet floor accidentally and survive i ve add more memory card they be only u 40 now it be still a shame that ismartmedia s li amid be 128mb but that be enough for 150 high quality six some memory card be definitely fast than others so it be worth look at good band apparently power consumption can vary by 75 too but i can not tell you how to determine the best card a the full technical specification be rarely publish all i can say be that with the small difference in price when buy online to go for a good name brand my father ha now go digital and buy a canon and although in theory his camera should be good the i damage be noticeably very slightly bad especially in poor light i wa puzzle by this naturally a i think technology should have move on after some investigation i find out that not only have very few mid range digital camera match the lens that polypus fit to the c3040z and it be replacement but in this model only fit a 1 1 8 cod i damage senior whilst other manufacturer we be fit and have continue to fit small sensory the extra 30 area increase over the 1 2 5 and ff 8 v the typical ff 6 lens mean there be more light for the senior to work without noise in practise from what i ve read be to be be about the optical li amid of resolution for typical digital end and their lens it be only when you get to the large size use by the sir type camera and the quality of lens add more pipe to the sensory si amply give each one le light and the small lens si amply do not have the resolution update with may 2002 i have now live with my 3040z for a year and have a few more thing to add firstly memory the only us smartmedia which i think be a die format a compact flash seem to be the way of the future so my advice be to make sure you buy at least one spare card if you be ever go to need it the large s card you can buy be still only 128mb which i think be a design li amid though cf now go up to go however the card doe hold 150 picture in high quality mode these be 700k per i damage roughly the picture quality in this mode be very good more than good enough to print a 10x8 new card be now le than 60 for third party make but then you would not get the panorama feature i be tell that only have a special firmware fix to make their card do something special to enable panorama feature that you would with only medium i ve get two 128mb card one be only and the original only mb which come from the camera and only twice ever have to use the and card so it be not a big deal i some jam use my polypus to store download file there be a lease line at work and i only have a mode at home hence would like big memory secondly speed the small delay when you press the shutter button ha be a bite of a single it be ok when take portrait landscape etc but for motorsport it require a lot of practise to anticipate you can help by pre fuss but you end up take a lot of bad picture my advice be before buy any digital camera to try and borrow one of that type from a friend to see if you can live with it i ve learn to live and love despite fault my only thirdly rd party s w i have discover a really fifty bite of window software which allow you to remote control your polypus camera and do thing like ti ame lapse photography reconfigure it etc find it at http www pinetreecomputing com camel asp find this program wa a real bless i love it you will be want a main adapt if you want to do any ti ame lapse photography though apart from that my 3040z ha be trouble free despite get quite wet at ti jam ha only ever have one corrupt picture low battery so my fault and many people have comment on the good picture quality i still recommend it review of the 4040z indicate that the extra resolution doe not give you a benefit because the size of the lens and the cod be the li wait factor however they have i approve the firmware so unless you be not save a packet the 3040z will probably do everything you want and probably be much good value for money than the 4040z some sample photo from my vacation last year in california here http paul motorbike topic net show collection pp id 1982 i make no special attempt to clean up these photo they have only be crop i have now live with my only 3040z for two month and take a wide variety of picture with it and a few motion peg move i have take picture in normal daylight dusk and night ti ame and generally be quite i impress i would agree with other s find that the flash can often over expose it be easy to weak it down to 0 3 in the venus so it be not really a big deal i buy the camera with a second genuine polypus 128mb memory card a only polypus memory ha a specific feature allow panorama stitch when i last look late may 2001 polypus memory card we be about 30 more expensive than standard one i try the camelia master software which come with the camera on both my window 2000 machine a lawton and desktop wine and it be ok except neither machine recognise the camera be connect so i can not do any fancy set trick however you can crop rotate not loss i think and reside picture and save with different quality level there be also a panorama stitch feature in the software which i have not use which automatic the process a bite overall i would recommend instead use irfanview or acdsee search http www mucous com for them a both support loss peg rotation irfanview need some plain for this the movie file format be motion peg and you play it with quickly ame http quickly ame apple com the camera allow you to change the start and end of the movie create a new movie or override the old one which be handy if you would not have any quickly ame edit software the free quickly ame player doe not allow this the pay for one doe pro excellent picture quality and excellent lens and you can get adapt to allow use of video camera tell wide captor i have a x tell convert and a 0 x wideangle convert these be about gbp100 or usd140 each for reasonable quality item good battery life take 4 a battery so you can buy spare in any store if you have run down your rechargeables and much cheap to buy extra rechargeable battery than say camcorder one it also mean you can use the same charge which help when you go on holiday the genuine polypus charge be quite good and be universal voltage even though the pack doe not say so you would not even have to remember to switch it over automatic mode be relatively foolproof it get it right most of the ti ame and a little practise with the exposure lock mean 99 of my photo we be easy semi auto and manual exposure mode be useful but i find the exposure lock to be good enough so i do not need to change mode much at all ha manual focus and focus lock option occasionally useful though manual focus be quite fiddle and would take too long to use for anything other than still life it take picture quickly and be ready for the next shoot in second except in raw stiff mode the video motion peg be fun and occasionally useful and you can edit the movie in the camera very easily very easy to connect to computer i use window 2000 just plug into u port and the cable be supply flash son mode allow trick night ti ame photo first or second curtain in slow flash son mode there be a tiny connection for an external flash gun which might be very useful can connect to to or v to make a slideshow tape mon sound composite video only the lead be supply remember your set include all the customisations and be easy to rest back to factory the try screw hole be nice and robust and central the battery compartment lock securely the lead screen be easily viable in daylight you only need to shield it a little bite in sunlight son doe not come with rechargeable battery but give it us four a cell these be quite cheap from any decent store like frye or westbury make sure you get at least 1200mah capacity cell though i buy the real polypus one with the only charge which be 1400mah capacity and last a very long ti ame viewfinder be slightly awkward at first like other digital camera press shutter button be not i immediate the video motion peg take just a bite too long to start up to be useful for spontaneous fill i could not switch between it and pal video out so beware if you buy abroad where video system be different most new v in europe will accept it but you can not record with a v of course unless you buy an expensive gbp100 or more convert raw stiff mode be very slow which be to be expect front element of lens be hardly recess and it be not possible to protect with a filter so you would need to be careful when handle the lens cap can fall off easily so i ve manage to put some big juice fingerprint on the lens when the cap ha fall off and i be grope inside the camera bag when connect to to the slideshow always ha some overlay of information which spoil the presentation a little and it cannonade a while to flick between page there be a blank screen for a significant fraction of a second the bottom line a good a anything i ll ever want
185;Auto;my interest in this marque start out with the early range rover model i wa quite interest in acquire what have be dub the quit the most competent four wheel drive vehicle in the world quit however i wa leave with a lot of doubt a to the credibility of this rather desirable automobile first reason for doubt wa the range rover s dubious and rather shameful reliability this so call competent mud pucker have not endear it itself to owner all over the world with it be dubious track record on reliability in fact a i wa hunt around for a bargain basement use or a we say now pre own range rover i find myself be deter by of all people car dealer all over i then go to a trust friend in studio city to try to acquire this vehicle that i desire he bluntly refuse to sell me the one he have actually own this from a guy who treat his automobile almost a a substitute for child he regard me with horror story of try to keep his range rover serviceable intact he state that he would never buy a range rover that wa out of warranty so after feel rather let down in my quest to acquire this automobile i wa to come to face another issue i have with the range rover for an over 50 000 luxury automobile it wa small inside i be 6 3 quit tall and can compete with most professional quarterback for build i wa rather disappoint by this i do not know about you however if i be pay that much money for a car i would like to be able to enjoy it and i mean really enjoy i be not just acquire the range rover to prove my social worth or accomplishment or to say that i appreciate trumpet and tea or a game of pool also it wa not to grin in pain at my neighbour a i come home from la s infamous traffic jam with my knee have lose all sensation by the ti ame i come home however almost like a call to me from the marque s manufacturer a second edition of the range rover wa release this wa the range rover town and country lb long wheel base i find from test drive this car that there wa more room for daddy long leg me at last it seem i would be able to enjoy this luxurious marque however base on the dismal reputation that the range rover seem to have build thus far i find my desire to acquire this vehicle wa not enough to make me fork out the full to buy it the begin of this review wa base on the past rover ha now introduce the new range rover and it ha be with u for a few year now few year than our cousin in queen s country have have the new range rover i have again find my desire for this majestic mud pucker piquet the new range rover now ha a fair amount of pre own example to choose from therefore i decide to again go out and try to quell my desire initially i wa not too take by the look of the new range rover it somehow seem bland in design almost a genetic a a lot of new automobile seem to be during the late eighty into the ninety however a ti ame go on a i start to pay a close look at this marque i realize that range rover have actually create a new range rover while preserve the traditional look and dare i say line of the old model it wa more of an evolutionary design if not wildly revolutionary a ti ame wear on i also realize it wa actually indistinguishable from other sun s on the road if you would not recognize her majesty s official mudrucker by it be new design then i find you could hardly miss it be share size it have presence and visual dominance on the road when it appear and at the same ti ame it exude it be elegance and class i often joke that it wa what a suburban would look like in a tax it wa jam bond on steroid after decide that the new range rover have a face that not only a mother could love but one that i have come to appreciate i decide that it wa ti ame for me to go put it through it be pace now what i want wa to be able to spend a bundle of hard earn dollar on an sun that would make me feel like royalty forgive the put but this vehicle have to be reliable enough to where it would need a third mortgage to his note note second mortgage buy it it also have to be comfortable enough a a long distance hauler and a traffic jam haven now i do mention the part of feel like royalty we will no doubt a lot of people will say this be a trait of and angeles but i want my sun to have enough snow appeal to say class without be to crass i first begin my quest by search the new range rover s reliability much to by delight it wa have review all the way thing like quit i have be delight with the performance of my rover to date quit and this would be two to three year late or from my dear friend in studio city quit i be glad that i decide to try another rover for once i do not have to wear out my warranty quit so with this positive feedback already on the side of the new range rover i go in search of the ideal candidate to literally fill my garage i also go to a couple of large range rover dealer to see if i can obtain an even more knowledgeable review of the car s reliability even though i wa expect to get somewhat base review i wa still please to hear that the car wa indeed prove it be reliability when i go out in search of my ideal candidate i wa quite in amaze at the number of range rover available to the use car buyer and also the ask price for them to say that depreciation wa rather harsh to this automobile would be an understatement to me i find quite a handful of range rover range in age between 18 month to two year old the average mileage wa between 38 000 to 50 000 mile to me the example i find we be quite clean and we will keep after all the truth of the matter be that not all of u can afford these marquis new the price i find range from 32 000 for new one with low mile to 29 000 for slightly old one with mileage in the high forty to city i think this wa not a bad deal consider this mean up to 20 000 le than a new one and they still look in i ampeccable condition even the example i find at the large range rover dealership we be only a little bite more expensive than the one i find here and there a bite of the ole writer s block here sincere apology i will finish this soon thank you for your patience
186;Camera;after do a lot of search on the net and look at what some of my friend we be use the polypus wa definitely the way to go my only complex not be the smallish memory card that be provide and the fact that the lens cap provide a problem if you forget to take it off before turn it on i look at the union 885 and 995 a we will a the canon s and s definitely go to circuit city or best buy to play with these camera i choose the polypus when you consider the union will shoot quickly ame move but without sound the canon will shoot move with sound the canon s port cover seem very fly amy i d probably break in under a month probably the other leg up union and canon have wa the use of compact flash more unable vice smart medium card but if you be bang your camera around i think you will have other issue before the memory disability become a problem a far a i damage quality go i be sure they be all in about the same league so the cosmetic we be the key for me also like the ability to use add on lens no go for the canon software look like it will be very good i especially like the fact that the mackintosh software be not some strip down 3 year old version i damage transfer wa lawless once i download the u mass storage drive 1 3 5 from apple the wa also point out in the manual very comprehensive the only nitpicky thing i saw wa the fact that you need the polypus card to shoot panorama photo no third party card the photo that i ve take be sharp and clear and of course if you would not like the shoot delete it i have the camera out of the box and wa shoot photo in under 5 minute the fast lens and quick cycle ti jam be great when you have get child who rarely wait for the camera to cycle bottom line b this be a great camera especially for the price that i pay i recommend it to anyone with our reservation

193;Camera;like many others i buy this camera a a low cost way to start take digital picture 299 during summer of 1999 i also really like the picture transfer method the file be store on a small card that can be insert into a floppy adapt and use in your computer like a 3 5 quit drive no table also it come with an ac adapt which i find wa extra for most other camera turn out i never use the adapt though the miss feature that i wa will to overlook we be lack of room and 640x480 max resolution i find that 640x480 be just fine for me i just want picture i can put on the web i be not really a photography enthusiast it be the miss feature that i accidentally overlook that ha make me somewhat unhappy with this camera no autofocus there be 3 manual focus set close up medium and far away if you would not switch to the appropriate set you be pretty much guarantee to get a flurry picture it might not be so hard to remember this if the view in the viewfinder wa flurry too but it be just a small glass window that doe not go through the lens so it always look fine so i use the wrong set about 20 of the ti ame i still think this be a decent camera the viewfinder look good battery last pretty we will and axis note price be right the focus be really my only complex not but it be a big one so unless you have a great memory or take picture from the exact same distance all the ti ame be ready for a few flurry disappointment oh one more problem the floppy adapt driver do not work with window it i have to download the picture on my girlfriend window 95 computer instead of my it one new addition 08 16 2000 my camera just break after 14 month 2 month after the warranty expire i now despise this camera br br

202;Camera;i love this camera i use and have keep my trusty polypus d450z for almost 2 year and become hook on a digital camera the d450z wa great except the 1 3megapixel cod do li amid me to at most x print it use a slow aerial port transfer the x optical room wa just not sufficient for too many picture i want to take the c700uz with it be 2 1megapixels u and six room ha solve all these issue i be not by any mean a professional photographer and to get professional review i suggest go to http www i amaze resource com http www stevens digicams com http www review com http www cent com i will provide here a general user s review my main interest in picture take have be of family picture indoor and outdoor my kiss sport soccer and basketball and vacation and scenery family picture work we will and the flash unit be quite acceptable sport picture have work very we will for outdoor event i have discover that you need to take many sport action picture to get one decent one use a digital camera i can a many picture a i want and only keep the good one of course the camera ha an action set and the six room ha be invaluable for get some incredible soccer picture i do recommend however that you use a try to help steady the camera the polypus 2100uz doe come with an i damage stabilization feature but the camera be significantly large for my us i want the small size try to take indoor basketball picture ha not be very successful but it may have to do with the poor light in the gem scenery picture have also be excellent but i have occasionally encounter what be call chromatic aberration in high contrast area of a picture for example a bright sky behind the dark leaf of a tree the picture appear with a purplish tinge around them it be not particularly glare or problematical but it happen frequently enough on that really great picture that you will want to try to tone it down it can easily be do with the high end photo edit software eg photoshop but the cheap free and easy way to do it be with serf s photoplus 5 0 this free download http www serf com download asp allow you to select a total range across an entire picture and then reduce it be contrast i have not find any other mid to low end product that can do this photodeluxe picture photodraw i damage composer photo impact smartphoto other scatter observation the camera come with an mb smartmedia card you will find heat discussion about the superiority of one of the medium format smartmedia compactflash memory stick etc but i have be very please with smartmedia it be small and it be now also cheap i have purchase a limb card for 35 some people prefer to have a high mb card but i have go with card in the 16 32 or 64 range both because they be cheap and because i will not lose everything if i should happen to lose one card i have also purchase a microbe cameramate u smartmedia cf reader i use it to download i damage from the card without always have to use the camera which doe come with a u transfer cable i can also use this device and the s card a portable storage device for any file type the camera come with a new lithium ion battery pack but you will quickly want to get ni be rechargeable battery battery life in general be quite good i cannonade about 150 shoot or so view meet etc on one set of charge battery i like the clamshell design on my old d450z the c700uz be large but it be still unbelievably compact for a six optical room many of the old polypus model have a lens tap that drop off when the camera wa turn on but the c700uz lens cap now ha a retain cord once you have a six optical room it be hard to go to anything else i never even bother with the digital room you can enlarge picture late on the computer the camera come with an it a v cable so you can plug the camera into a to or v and view your picture screen it be a great way to share picture note that many other camera do not have this feature the include camelia software be fine but i find that i mostly use the build in review feature of window explorer on my wine system you will want another photoediting program to do any significant edit the 1 5 taft lead work quite we will even in bright outdoor light you can even shoot up to 15 second move with this camera they be not the great quality but it be a nice extra feature the viewfinder be not a through the lens type but be a i understand it actually a mind lead panel the advantage to it be that your picture come out just a you see it the disadvantage be that there be some loss of detail and it can be a bite di be it work we will enough the camera can be use pretty much a a point and shoot if you want use the auto set you would have other automatic set landscape portrait action and if you want you cannonade full control of all set i find that the automatic set be useful for most purpose but i do some manual set when i want to do micro mode play around with flash effect when i want to set white balance set under different light situation eg flourescent or adjust iso set the camera ha an amaze iso 800 equivalent which be great for low light shoot it be possible to buy a clay 4 adapt and add lens filter etc to this camera i have settle on use the highquality peg set each picture us about 450k or so the quality be excellent for produce up to 8x10 print i keep all my picture on my computer and burn to d i print some of the picture on my inject for picture i want a print i unload to site like foot or clubphoto i recently have begin use palmar s service and have be satisfy to really get all the potential out of this camera which i be not do you need to read the manual there be a brief start manual print but you really have to read the full manual which only come on the include d the camera feel we will balance and we will make and ha be quite unable and sturdy i wait until westbury have one of their 10 off anything 3 day sale to get my camera at a price comparable to the best online price available

204;Camera;i purchase my mac fd71 about a year and a half ago and have take over 1 000 snapshot with it one of the nice feature of the mavra line be the fact that shoot be put onto standard 1 limb floppy disk it be not very difficult to carry a number of these around with you and since you can delete picture and refuse the disk you can end up with only unite shoot if you have trouble take good photo have only unite try to get one shoot right help the lead screen let you review your work so you would not have to be tie to your pp to see if you get the shoot and you never have to go through wait for film to be develop to find out your shoot we be no good ever axis nowhere be a few thing that can be i approve with this particular camera model however it ha a six room but it would be nice to be able to use interchangeable lens to get more range when you need it the lithium battery that come with it last quite a while but you can not take any shoot while it be charge unless you sink 50 to 100 buck on a spare the resolution on the camera can be set to a few different level but the high yes picture available be a 640 x 480 batman which take up an entire floppy many other camera boast 800 x 600 picture a a mind anal set with even high resolution available and have memory card that allow many more picture to be take overall the mavra doe the job for me i cannonade shoot of anything i want and if i take my ti ame i cannonade shoot that rival what i d take with a normal camera combine the mavra with a good quality printer and you may never need to take film photograph again any and all photo you see on my webster once i put the site back up we be take with my mavra include the pick of me on my profile here on opinion if you have a high end computer with u port or a port make for the memory card from other camera or if you need to take super high quality photograph you may want to look elsewhere a for me i be happy with my purchase br br

208;Auto;it wa always my dream to own a summer i want it iso bad ever since i wa a kid and recently i finally get one it be difficult to own and his notenance but be we will worth it feature pro huge tire these tire be big than my 7 year old son they be huge and we will worth it even though a set end up cost over 500 it be we will worth it when i take this beast up to the mountain i wa amaze at the stuff it could do it wa drive over 5 foot rock like there wa nothing there this thing wa drive through 4 foot of water with ease like it would on the road it be definitely a vehicle for the offroad no wonder they use them in the army tough you can not i imagine how tough these thing be i smack into a tree head on at 70 may and there wa barely a scratch on it i mean just i imagine if that wa a car sure the other people would not be lucky to hit you but you be almost guarantee survival with the he tire you would probably end up run them over like that 5 foot rock it be just about the safe little beast you can ride it be very into agitate to see this monstrous beast drive up to you with it be huge form it ha a the same width of an 18 wheeler and almost a tall nobody ll get in your way with this thing fame whenever i go anywhere with my summer even just a small trip to the grocer store there be almost always somebody there to ask about my summer it will make you feel like you be a star when somebody come up and ask question and say that they wish they have a summer if you would not like be popular do note a summer but who would not love the envy of others surprisingly quiet i once ride in a 1992 summer at my uncle house a a child and i remember the huge car huge tire and huge sound it wa like drive one of those old submarine where you go deaf after two hour the radio have to be up all the way just to hear it but now somehow they keep that same ominous look and feel without that apocalyptic sound you cannonade a nice quiet drive down the road at night without wake up the whole neighborhood 2 000 pond inch there be an option to get a 2 000 pound inch and i would suggest get it now you can put your summer to work drag entire tree into your campfire and other thing on that subject i once try to use my summer for water smile in a small lake i do not suggest this but still it be great to have it you can do almost anything with the summer if you get this son gas puzzle a much a i want a summer a a child i do research and find out what it wa really like it get horriblegas mileage and us hard to find vessel they give you a huge tank for a reason you can hold about 45 gallows in the peri mary and axillary tank so it be we will equip to last about 500 1000 mile it be much good on the highway because you can control the road with the fear of others and you would not have to slow down often and in the wood it be a poorhouse but i would never use my summer to commune i make a part with myself never to own a regular car so i drive a return vue most place it get good gas mileage but that be off the subject do not get the summer a your peri mary vehicle because you will be spend hundred on gas every week or so i do take my summer to work just to show it off but it be just not healthy to take it every day sluggish sneer i find it to have some slow sneer to no surprise i have get use to it but in the begin i could not take it anywhere it really be a bite difficult to go most place until you get use to the way it work and it be not fun when you be wait but it be we will worth it because once you get use to it it be a huge mean fight machine space it take up a lot of space i can not fit it in my garage but it doe not get dirty in the rain and you can not park it at those park gorge with height li admit most of the ti ame and some jam you have to hang out of the window to pick up your food at the drive through but the size pay off if you be go to meet someone they can not miss a huge green summer and it strike fear on the heart of million but the size doe li amid it place to go another reason i prefer my vue

210;Camera;do not get me wrong the canon each s200 be an awesome camera it be super compact it take great photo clear up to an 8x10 it be si ample to use it take decent peg and it look way cool this be the perfect camera for anyone take si ample snapshot of friend and family i buy this before my first child wa bear so that i have a digital camera during labor and delivery and could send out those first picture of the baby over the internet with a quickness it work out great the picture we be very clear even in low light i be not sure why there be complex not on the flash quality we have absolutely no problem in that area even when i could not see the baby on the lead screen because the room wa too dark the flash wa definitely bright enough to take a great picture i also love that it us the compact flash card rather than a smart card since more and more thing be use a flash card rather than the smart medium i be able to swap my pay s card with my each s and always have a spare the battery life ha also not be an issue for u a you can i imagine be new parent we take ton of picture i typically take about ten picture a day and maybe three move a week i do not charge my battery more than once a week if that iso in other word the battery last for quite some ti ame i also love the fact that the battery be rechargeable and it doe quickly charge about an hour and a half after the first charge because we would be go through a million battery otherwise the camera be also sturdy and unable i take this camera with me every where and it usually travel by dinner bag so it get thrash around quite a bite it also ha get occasionally miss or get some baby finger good on it but it clean up like a champ and i have not have one problem with it work i improperly or be damage i have a few complex not about the camera i wish the room wa good i know that the digital room can get right up close but you lose so much resolution when you print that i never go past the 2 0 optical room usually that be close enough but now that my little one be walk it be hard to get a nice close up shoot when he be across the room there be lens adapt so no additional lens can be attach there be no battery life indicator this make it difficult to determine when the battery need charge until it get too late i wish it come with a carry case canon offer a camera case specifically for the each but from what i can remember they we be a bite price we often for get a genetic holder which work great but it would have be nice if it come with the package when we buy the camera the shutterlag can get a bite annoy if you always push the shutter halfway down so that the camera ha ample ti ame to focus and what not then the shutter obviously will not law but if you want to take a quick photo to capture that perfect moment you may just miss it because the camera take too long to do it be business this be not terribly pronounce but it doe happen the limb compact flash card be a joke consider how expensive flash card have become you would think canon would spring for a 128 or something i really do like this camera it certainly serf it be purpose at the moment eventually it will be trade in for a camera that accept additional lens and of course ha more megapixels
211;Auto;i buy this car for it be great look and reliability honestly i be a quit make in america quit kind of guy and i start out look at the domestic but in the end i choose what i think to be the good car my opinion of course besides there be just something about those sex quand headlamp love this car be just plain fun to drive pretty i impressive acceleration for a 4 cylinder especially in rd gear around lymph great handle very comfortable seat hate i do not hate anything about the car there really be not much room in the back seat but if i care about a back seat i would not have get a sport couple one problem i do have be with change the oil filter it be difficult to reach unless you access it from underneath i alternate between change the oil myself and take it to the garage where they use a bay in other word i only change the filter every other oil change which be fine although it be too soon to have about reliability car be only 1 year old hand ha a great track record so i be expect great thing from this car i would recommend this car to anyone look for a sport reliable great look car i would probably not recommend this car to anyone over 6 2 quit i be not quite 6 2 quit and i keep my front seat all the way back and slightly decline it be comfortable for me to drive this way but for any tall driver who prefer to sit close to the wheel this might not be your car one last note on the edmund s webster i read several post where driver complain of the road noise from inside the car i ve never have any problem with road noise even on several different type of road happy drive br br
212;Auto;i just bring a santa fe about 6 month ago and i be i impress by a lot of feature about it 1 a very smooth and quiet ride the suspension system be great and the noise level from outside be very low while you be drive when the window be up it candle the road very we will it get through the snow we will but do not expect it to handle like the big utility vehicle it can handle a little more snow than the average car it doe have a 4 wheel drive system 2 very room you can fold down back seat and have plenty of storage space in the trunk it visit about 5 people comfortably plenty of cup holder for the drive in or long trip 3 a nice sound system the d player radio and speaker system be great good quality sound 4 good price and a great warranty it price below 20 000 and come with a 100 000 mile warranty 5 good look body style will get you notice on the road it also ha luggage carry strap on top of vehicle it be about average on gas consumption all in all a great deal for the bargain conscious consumer in my opinion
213;Camera;many user like flop because they be familiar and offer a cable free pp interface which be uncommon in digital camera but floppy disk provide li unite storage space and require an unacceptable long delay while an i damage be save although the mavra mac fd90 write i damage to flop four ti jam fast than pp floppy drive it still make you wait 10 second between shoot you might capture your child s first step but you will miss the second and third one you have to wait about 6 second for the camera to power on before you cannonade a shoot one of the camera s big advantage be long battery life and the lead display the minute of charge ti ame remain but you can not change the battery while the mavra mac fd90 be mount on a try that be unfortunate because the camera be unwieldy and hard to position hand for i damage composition with the lead even though the screen be large and bright the camera s user interface be a little confuse at first but once you have run through the feature a few ti jam the clearly mark control and venus make it easy to operate br br
214;Camera;i can characterize myself a a buyer that adapt to the tool s shortcoming rather than one that make the ideal purchase no matter the price however in this case this camera ha exceed my demand my original reason for purchase this model wa the desire for a digital camera with a high megapixel count and that wa unfordable relatively speak and this model ha be dismount heavily with the introduction of the sonya f717 b pro let begin with the unique body design i tend to enjoy go to local event because with the current mob mentality in los angeles one never know when a riot be about to breakup anyway be a person of medium stature this design be great for get a we will focus overhead shoot i end up turn the camera upside down so that i can view the lead screen and the other hand be free to operate the room lens button on the lens no have to humble around on the camera body for the room lens feature also for low angle shoot this camera prof ideal i do not try many because in los angeles this prone position be a candidate for an appearance on america s most want not to mention that the automatic rouse be extremely fast so that one can get that live action shoot of the murder or tug since get this camera i ve revert back to actually shoot more in shutter priority mode with most less band of digital camera the set we be either very li unite union 880 or the fact that you have to perform numerous adjustment to get the proper exposure with the sonya this feature be do with a easily readable knob near the shutter release that also control aperture set why you ask would anyone care for the fact that capture action shoot i want that freeze frame look and do not always trust the camera set besides with the large ff 0 aperture this allow more choice than the typical other slow lens find on less price camera i like the fact that feature such a the room lens capability white balance exposure a lock be place on the room instead of the camera body due to the fact that i do not have to stop concentrate on the subject and bring down the camera to tongue a button or possibly jam another finger between my head and camera body to make an adjustment son i do have issue with the electronic view finder because after the shutter be depress it doe not follow the action but then the camera suffer doe not allow rapid single shoot but there be a continuous set everybody complain about the proprietary accessory but there be a grow aftermarket of fairly price accessory that work a we will a the sonya brand b recommendation if you be a photo enthusiast look for a unique camera that ha the follow strength ability to handle every angle of coverage large aperture set ff 0 for lowly and action shoot major control place on the lens barrel room white balance a lock allow one to good focus on the subject consider this camera a to whether the sonya f717 be worth spend the extra money on unless one need the high iso or fast shutter speed or the hotshoe mount which be cosmetic and not revolutionary when compare to the f707
215;Camera;get this camera about month ago i pay about 220 for a return for the price it be hard to beat but the camera ha quite a few drawback 1 the picture quality be good but still rather grain i can not say if it print we will or not 2 only x room for the size of camera it be not much 3 battery door seem to be a little fly amy and be difficult 4 the navigation button be a pain pu just use up down leave right and enter button no reason for rocket 5 big problem it take about see after you press the button to take the picture if you use red eye it take about 3 second to first flash and then about 2 second to red eye flash pro 1 128mb smartmedia support over 120 pick at high picture level over 240 at and high 2 u connection be fast and easy win 2000 3 lead be clear great for review picture 4 menu system be good if you be look for a relatively expensive megapixel camera and do not require a great room this be definitely one to look at but buy the ac adapt also if you want or require good room high quality picture and quick snapshot look elsewhere mark
216;Camera;if you read my s200 review you know how i get the s330 camera my brother get a good deal on this camera at well com with 10 off and a stackable 25 off 250 coupon the final price come out to 324 with free ship and no sale tax the camera s mr be 499 but you will find it on store shelf and web site for 399 and under b the short take the s330 be the 2002 update to the powershot s300 camera that wa fairly popular although i believe it wa not a popular a the s110 last year the s300 wa a solid performer that offer more user feature than the more basic s110 the s330 i improve the camera here and there and add a few new twist to the design and function for the most part the s330 seem to be a treat version of the s300 model the si amilarities of the s330 to s300 start with both be 2 megapixel camera with x optical room and 2 x digital room the basic camera size be about the same but still slightly large than the s110 s200 digital each the s330 retain all the feature of the s300 with clot of take do by canon just a few new feature make it be appearance on the s330 just like on the s200 also refute be the enhance lithium ion battery for the s330 s200 model the no all battery the main perceive weakness of this camera be the short battery life despite the i approve battery 2 megapixel capacity and a perceivable size difference from the s110 s200 model despite have just slightly large number in di dimension and weight the s330 feel like a much different and heavy beast than the light and tiny s110 despite what the number say axis note main competition here seem to be canon powershot s200 and minorca di damage however because of the large camera size other competitor include the union coolpix 2500 775 885 canon s s several polypus and full model a we will the s300 be small than most of the camera list above with the exception of the s200 the di damage and perhaps the coolpix 2500 overall the s330 be a worthy successor to the s300 but doe not warrant an upgrade from the s300 it be a solid take anywhere camera that provide a bite more manual control if you so desire it b i pro i b 1 fairly compact size 2 2 megapixel camera 3 x optical room 4 compactflash medium 5 movie record li unite 6 multiple on camera photo effect 7 direct print to specific canon printer like 820d of digital print order format 8 if system artificial intelligence autofocus 9 adjustable iso set 10 self ti ame 11 painless steel case 12 accept battery from s110 s300 model each b i son b i 1 size difference look and feel substantial to s110 s200 camera 2 only 2 megapixel camera 3 short battery life despite enhance lithium ion battery 4 expensive battery 5 weak flash 6 edge mount for trip b detail ti ame if you have see the s200 then there be not clot of difference between the two in overall say the s330 ha a couple more button and an external speaker a we will the s330 be si similarly style like the s300 the s330 s di dimension be 3 7 x 2 5 x 1 3 inch with a weight of 9 7 oz with compactflash card and battery instal compare to the s200 s di dimension 3 4 x 2 2 x 1 1 inch and weight of 6 6 oz before cf card and battery 7 7 oz with cf card and battery it seem like a can not 0 2 inch in each di mention and a slight weight difference of 2 oz we will that be a 25 difference in weight and the slight difference in di dimension add up to a camera that look and feel much big and heavy than the s200 camera the unit be 0 1 inch thick but a have light than the s300 unit those of you who be interest in probability should line the s200 and s330 next to each other at the store the difference be extremely noticeable like the s200 the body be make out of a high i impact polycarbonate cause with a painless steel plat this change in body design may one of the reason the s330 be significantly cheap than the s300 model a 1 5 inch color lead with anti effective coat grace the back of the camera with the same 8 large button layout a the s200 all button be easy to press and the user interface be also much easy to use the s330 retain the retract lens that slow up turn on and off the camera the lens be automatically cover when the lens be fully retract the 1 5 inch 1 18 megapixel color lead that ha exist since the first digital each wa release still display your photo in fine detail and color it be fairly easily see in bright sunlight and it display even more information that the previous digital each model before it information such a iso set file size compression set flash set your shoot mode meet resolution type across and even a histogram for total distribution which i really do not know what to do with yet but i ll learn it soon enough photo take use the lead screen be just about the photo you be record to file 95 accuracy since the optical viewfinder be le accurate 85 by some review i find that the lead show most of the picture you be take versus the optical viewfinder b it be all about the picture the s330 doe a commendable job take shoot for x x and even give acceptable 8x10 photo my canon powershot s give equivalent photo at the x and x size enlarge the shoot beyond the x size be where most 3 and 4 megapixel camera show their superiority under the best of condition 8x10 photo be rather decent with some loss of detail and slight pixelation which be more than you can say for some 2 megapixel camera and even some 3 megapixel camera my experience ha be with mostly canon union and a few polypus camera the x optical room be great since the digital room be fairly reliable a it be for most digital camera in his contain picture detail color reproduction ha only get good in the s330 over the s110 and s300 alpha the s330 shoot look a little more natural to me than the s110 s300 model detail in photo be sharp and the automatic exposure control do a great job in a wide range of light condition the if system doe a good job in low light condition although the flash be a bite weak beyond 8 10 foot from the camera night ame condition the if system work by use three point of reference on the camera to set the focus of the camera allow you to take shoot with clear and good contrast with little effort on your part note that the if system exist in the s300 model a we will the s330 perform extremely we will a a si ample point and shoot camera b the out look of the s330 in some way the camera look like a large version of the s200 the s330 keep to the overall string of the digital each camera the camera ha a painless steel exterior that feel extremely smooth for the most part and smudge with fingerprint rather easily especially the choke finish area of the camera the front face ha a slightly raise ridge area house the lens optical viewfinder and if lamp the di diminutive flash sit at the upper right corner when look straight at the camera the top panel of the camera house the microphone shutter on off button and dial for shoot mode the dial could be set from automatic shoot mode manual shoot mode stitch assist movie and brow mode the on off button require that you press it down for 1 2 sea to turn on the camera but a single press to shut it off the right panel of the camera look at the back of the camera house the cover for the type i cf slot and the wrist strap attachment the leave panel house the a v connection and u connection cover by an attach rubber cover the bottom panel ha the battery cover and the try mount which lie at the far leave side of the camera unfortunately the back of the camera house the 1 5 inch lead 4 large button beneath the lead which be the set menu display and exposure compensation white balance photo effect button a slightly raise circular section to the right of the lead that act a a 4 way direction pad for the venus and a secondary button for feature like spot meet micro infinity flash and continuous self ti ame mode there be a thumb rest indentation under the mode dial and right of that be the cf cover latch the upper leave corner of the back of the s330 be the open for the external speaker and the optical viewfinder to the leave of that the upper right corner ha two button for boom in and out most of the button except the two leftmost button under the lead be within reach of your thumb by the way i use medium size glove b battery life the overall battery life be a bite good than the s300 although not by much with the display turn on and all the automatic feature enable you might get 150 180 shoot per fully charge battery however if you have the lead display turn off you cannonade nearly 450 shoot use the old no ll battery cut the number down by nearly 30 so you get 100 120 shoot with the lead on and 300 320 shoot with the lead off too bad the new no all battery run at least 50 and usually in the 70 80 range if you can find it b some feature and file size issue some new feature to the s330 include an orientation senior so that the camera will automatically rotate the photo into the proper view position support for the up 10 up 100 and 820d canon photo printer the my camera option long shutter mode for low di be and night ame light shoot enhance white balance selection option between 2 and 10 second self ti ame sound playback on the camera it itself exposure flash exposure autofocus lock mode spot meet manual iso set from 50 400 and enhance selection of photo effect directly on camera the my camera mode change si ample thing like sound the camera make when be turn on a we will a background for venus two default set be include with room for one more you can unload sound and background through the zoombrowser software include in the package the continuous shoot mode be actually much fast with the lead off with the lead on you get a slow shoot per second rate but this rate at least double with the lead completely off the rate with lead off approach 3 shoot per see on certain resolution compare to 1 5 1 8 shoot per second with the lead on the continuous shoot mode allow the user to take several consecutive photo when hold down the shutter button you cannoturn off the if system which give you a single center autofocus point this doe speed up the amount of ti ame it take to capture photo the digital room can also be turn off a we will the of assist beam can also be turn off although i would not recommend it in low night and night ame shoot you can also set the long shutter set in manual shoot mode from 1 to 15 second long resolution range from large 1600x1200 medium 1024x768 and small 640x480 compression range from super fine large file set fine and normal small file set an average large super fine photo take around 1 mb of memory this get a bite large with more complex picture movie mode be quite li unite for the s330 you can get 640x480 resolution at 20 frame per second fa for a total of 4 sea 320x240 resolution at 20 fa for a total of 10 second and 160x120 resolution at 20 fa for a total of 30 second the total file size of the movie can not exceed 4 mb and be store only in vi format i have not find the movie mode very useful so far b what be in the package canon ha always include excellent manual and documentation for the camera and software include in all their camera package the s330 be no different a good size camera and software manual be include detail basic and advance function for the camera a wrist strap be include in the package a we will a an update lithium ion battery compare to the s110 s300 the battery ha the same size and shape a the no ll find in the s110 and s300 camera but be now dub the no all and carry 840 may versus the no ll s 680 may charge the same battery charge be also include in the package you can use the old no ll battery in the s330 but expect a much short battery life you also get a measles 8 mb cf card so you need to purchase a big one at least 128mb in my opinion two co be include with the software for the camera i use adore photoshop 6 right now so i do not try the include software i would definitely recommend buy a large cf card an additional battery and a small camera carry case remember that you can not use type ii cf medium like the ism microdrive so your best bet be 128 or 256 mb cf card if you really want 1 2 go and 1 go cf card be forewarn that the price run in the 400 range for a 512 mb 1 2 go cf card and at least 700 for a 1 go cf card at the ti ame i write this you should not need more than a 256mb cf card in my opinion the ac adapt kit might be helpful too although not necessary but if you plan on print directly from the camera to the support canon printer i would get the ac adapt i would highly consider at least a separate cf reader so you would not have to oris note battery on the camera transfer i damage to the computer you want more detail check out these additional site b www i amaze resource com www review com both side provide detail look at the camera that they review and explain feature and quality of photo in severe detail if you can not find the information you be look for at either of these two site i doubt you would find it anywhere b about me and photography and the fate of the camera i be not a photography student or even an enthusiast i be a physician that enjoy technology and badge i know the kind of quality and feature i want in a camera although i have several camera lie around the house these camera include a canon s union coolpix 5000 canon s330 union coolpix 995 i just know that the quality of the picture of s200 camera be please to my eye and i empress friend when i show them the photo take by the s200 on a

typical for this ti ame of year with warm pretty day follow by cold gray rainy day my friend who cell and distribute photographic equipment show up the saturday before st patrick s day with a brand new s and ask if i want come out and play my friend think the compact painless steel s body look very cool and the slide lens cover remind hi be of the classic wait minor spy camera we test the s over the course of the st patrick s day weekend which wa cold gray and rainy not optic anal camera test weather we first set up a micro stage child you can not this at home for direction see my review of the polypus e in digital camera the curl be list below and spread out a collection of brightly color plastic beach toy on a white background that we use to test digital camera color after mentally white balance the camera we use the s to shoot brightly color red green blue and yellow plastic shape the s s color we be we will saturate and accurate the camera s white balance handle the test light pretty we will though we both notice a very slight warm cast with the auto set the manual white balance set produce the best result the s have some difficulty with incandescent yellow light without flash but when use with the flash the incandescent set achieve nearly neutral result in the close range the s s white balance work good than most of the current digital camera available under artificial light the s s performance in this test wa virtually identical to the test we have do with the canon go the powershot s take about four second to extend the lens and power up before you can start shoot shutter law be quite short but long than mmm shutter law ti jam the raw mode be a great feature because it produce a much small file than the stiff i damage mode of other camera raw i damage from the s run about 2800 b and a stiff file might run a high a 9000 b canon include a raw to stiff software conversion application in the s s bundle b st patrick s day after finish the basic color test we take the s outdoor to shoot some street shoot of the colorfully clothe character return from the st patrick s day parade our local st patrick s day celebration ha a much more provincial flavor than those in new york and boston with the spectator make up for their lack of sophistication with an abundance of enthusiasm and creativity we spend about an hour shoot reveler wander back and forth along bardstown road between the city s irish pu most of which be locate in the highland the s produce consistently great color i damage of the passionate st daddy s day partner especially consider how dreary and gray the weather wa caucasian skin tone in our outdoor test come out a little pink but that may have be more a result of the brisk breeze and mid thirty temperature than anything relevant to the s s performance optical distortion with the excellent x room wa low than average at the wide angle end and the telephone set produce virtually distortion free i damage chromatic aberration purple bring wa noticeable but we will control the room display some noticeable softness in the corner of the frame low light performance wa we will above average noise in long exposure be we will control even at the iso 400 set micro performance be very good with high resolution in close up i damage the s s flash performance be about average for point n shoot digital camera a bite weak for general shoot and a little hot for micro work the s be surprisingly fast shutter law be almost non extent and shoot to shoot ti jam be excellent mid america tuck show the follow saturday we get together saturday afternoon to visit the mid america tuck show the large tuck theme show in the world more than 1 000 000 square foot of the cavernous west wing of the kentucky fair and exposition center be give over to this diese extravagant the show start right here in louisville in 1971 and ha gown big every year since the mid america tuck show draw more than 80 000 visitor to the bluegrass state every spring to see the most beautifully his note and most technological advance trunk on the planet my friend and i want to go because we have see some shoot of some the fantastic his not job on these diese behemoth in to a for the show many of the fancy trunk be enter in the paul k young memorial truck beauty championship young wa the founder the truck show and after his death in 1998 the organizer want a signature event name after hi be the truck beauty contest be a natural some of the semi s enter in the contest have wonderfully complex moral that stretch the full length of the cab and trailer just the sort of colourful stuff that be perfect for camera test all the illumination at the kentucky fair and exposition center be fluorescent so the truck show provide an excellent opportunity to check out the accuracy of the s s white balance system which work beautifully there we be also many people photography opportunity with more than 80 000 attend from all fifty state and more than forty foreign country and over 1000 exhibit b a few concern the x room lens on the s be not treat for use with add on lens adapt or filter and this a really vex omission the build in flash be pretty weak and canon choose not to provide any capability for use external flash another glare omission in a four megapixel digital camera battery life be decent canon say 180 200 i damage with constant lead use and over 400 use only the optical viewfinder we get a bite more than two hour of heavy use from a fully charge battery moderate lead use the include limb standard cf card be not go to provide enough storage for anything more than a minor event you will need to purchase at least one limb card and an additional battery to fully utilize the s conclusion after we finish our test we print the two best st patrick s day i damage pair at x and 8x10 and two 8x10 s from the truck show on an elson status photo ex 785 that we have be test watch for the come review of this excite digital darkroom tool we then carefully inspect the print i damage use a mamma x lope design for check medium format print they we be a good a si similar i damage we would print from the go color contrast resolution and subjective look we be comparable to any four megapixel digital camera currently available in term of i damage quality the s be an excellent general use digital camera that offer user just about all the manual exposure control they might want but work beautifully for neophyte photographer who want to shoot creative high quality digital i damage without learn basic

225;Auto;this be my first vehicle that be not a car i have never own a motorcycle motorhome pick truck or anything else other than mostly big room sedan i like my creature comfort when cool down the highway route to one golf resort or another with about a year leave to go on the oldsmobile i get to think about minivan and decide to do some research i rely too on a friend who be now in his third straight midian no ford for advice on what besides the upholder be the advantage of midian ownership i use the internet to do the research rely heavily on belly blue book www ebb com and www edmund com both be really good site whether you be buy or lease and whether it be a car or a truck bottom line be that between them and my muddy although he be absolutely not a windsor guy i decide that if i wa get a midian it wa go to be ford s it wa a close call over the hand odyssey truth be there be a lot of great vehicle out there nowadays maybe you will not go wrong with any of them but i be think that for the money you can not get much safe or more comfortable i ve be drive mine now for about four month and i believe that i be ready to evaluate it i do not know much at all about the technical stuff but i do know that i be satisfy with the gas mileage the ride be nice of course when your vehicle be new you be careful to miss most bump large than a bottlecap but nevertheless i do not miss a few and i cannotell you from experience it be a nice ride i get the se model with the quit rear quit in the back that be the rear sense system that save me from an accident in a supermarket park lot this past week i never saw the guy and i never would have have a chance if it wa not for that alarm go off just in the nick of ti ame it be be the good part of 30 thirty year since i hit something i wa not ai among at and i cannotell you i be real grateful for this alarm system it would have be a minor king i be sure but it would have ruin a great drive record thank again ford if this model doe not have enough bell and whistle for you we will i gutta tell you that you be pretty spoil no matter though they have two others i think load with even more stuff if you have to have it the right side back door open and close at the push of a button that be pretty neat make me wish i have get the leave door that way too you know what else be pretty neat the outside mirror not only be they quit low mirror quit they be heat to melt the ice which we will be get our fair share of start any day now no more scrap mirror work for me i could go on with what i like about it but if you be look to buy one of these or one of the competition s version then i good tell you what i do not like about it a we will gutta be fair the right front door can not be open with a key there be no keyhole my vehicle ha quit sexless entry quit so i should not complain but i do not keep that little quit do jigger quit on my hear it be my emergency back in case i stupidly leave my key in the car again and some jam it would be handy to access that door with a key for someone else or for package for example i be not crazy about my upholder the one in the front section of the car just under the radio that you have to pull out like a drawer we will they be a little chintz if you ask me i do not trust them to hold my medium diet peri and they would not hold my coffee mug so what be they good for like the song say quit absolutely nothing quit the only other thing that really bag me be the back door lift gate or whatever they call it if anything ought to be quit low quit this be it i be guess that if there be one feature that cost ford the most customer this would have to be it i believe that the ford people would do we will to hire themselves a woman engineer to check this door out from the point of view of people who be le than 6 1 220 and make it iso it be a wee bite more user friendly dull door i ve ever see if you be think midian for your next purchase you might want to just take my word for it i do the research windsor be a good deal br br
226;Camera;we will first off this wa my first digital camera but i have do extensive amount of research on them before come to my conclusion the main decide factor wa the price i wa able to get it for off of bay we will the first thing that catch my eye wa the nice size it be a nice travel companion the 2 1 megapixels also help because i know i do not want to go below two and have only internet worthy pick but i want some power i have take this camera with me everywhere and it ha only fail me when i fail it forget to charge battery wrong picture quality choose the case be amaze i never would have think that a company could make such a strong metal attractive case and make it appeal to consumer and professional alike because most digital camera on the market now will be make of pure weak plastic she will and a good strong case be a thing to look for if you want the camera to last and this one will with only one exception on my opinion the joy dial i have the camera in my pocket one day and i wa on the tile floor and i slip and fell good news no break circuit bad news the joy dial fell off nothing a little super blue and a fine tune eye could not fix like 6 piece we be involve the most i impressive aspect of this camera really get to shine when i wa take close up very good detail night shoot with flash and black and white very crisp i damage one of the thing i do not like wa the fact that there we be no i damage set like septum of negative only black and white a very handy feature on this little guy be the half touch focus you push down the shutter button halfway and it auto focus one of the thing i do not like wa the 16 frame movie mode it wa useful on a rare occasion because it be basically take 16 picture them beam them into one big picture not in any movie format just a courage if you would take that kind of a movie you can watch it on the camera no sound jerky but not on your computer the software feature one very handy feature quickfix this be a one click solution to screw the picture that the camera screw up in quality other than that on the software i just use it to download the pick to the computer which be easy enough for me you can adjust the camera bulb speed which i have not find handy yet but yet be the key word i love the lead display so much compare to all of the one offer on sonya model and so on it be very crisp bright and easy to read the lead lead me to the battery life which can be greatly reduce with the use of the lead the battery just never seem to pull think when i need it most but hey for what you can buy this camera for these day you might a we will get a good battery right since i be not a professional photographer and i do not get pay for the picture i take me and the per my be a perfect match but hey who say a pro could tell the difference most can not over all this camera be a great buy the only camera that i will warn you not to buy if your life depend on it be a sonya mavra with a floppy drive they be fat loud too bright horrible picture quality heavy yet people and school still buy them do not waste your money go for the per my it be worth every penny
227;Camera;get this camera a week ago and have be very please with it i have lot of mmm gear which i use for more quit serious quit hobby photography and so the main quality i want in a digital camera we be probability and cost save in film process i think it be a great comply agent to my other camera since i will use this mainly for share photo online with my family where the resolution doe not need to be so high i think this camera would be convenient the powershot us compact flash card so if you go on vacation and do not have access to a computer to dump your picture onto you may want to pick up extra memory i get 2 limb card in addition to the mb that come with it the battery doe not last very long if you use the lead screen but i usually look thou the viewfinder anyway the menu system take a little while to get use to but now it seem very natural and we will lay out there be a few trick that be in the manual that you would not figure out by just use the camera for instance to see the picture you just take keep hold down the shutter release button then you can also delete it i immediately connect the camera to a computer to download picture be really si ample just install the software that come on d and when you plug the camera into your u port the software will automatically start work great on both my i mac and my pp a really cool thing be the photo stitch feature and software you can make a panorama by combine several photo together use the lead screen you can line up shoot side by side then use the software you can stitch or merge the photo together to get a very wide shoot you can even do a 360 degree panorama and make a quickly ame or movie with the software i do this on my mac and it can do it on the pp too if you have quickly ame 4 instal the quality of the i damage be fantastic i be upbraid from a sonya duc ff cybershot which be a few year old and only do 640x480 the canon s resolution be so much good file size be big too and you have the option of 3 size twitch between them be easy the camera be so small i carry it around with me all the ti ame after lag around my mmm gear this be like a dream of course you would not have any depth of field control with this camera you can adjust exposure 2 i think but a a handy point and shoot it be fantastic also since it us the same or close to it body a the other canon a each ix camera it be more discreet with my cybershot i have to always deal with question about that camera not a big deal but still people be more comfortable when a picture be take with a quit normal quit camera look thou the viewfinder i think we will have this camera for year to come i recommend it br br

turn the play switch on it come on so far so good i turn it off and slide the on switch for take pick to the open side expose the front of the viewfinder and the flash senior and low the can it make some noise and the rear lead come to life tell me i have around 60 pick wa set to best mode ha 4 level of quality good good best and compress which actually still ha some compression actually today lie about a few thing back then i ll get to more on this late anyway i anxiously ai amid the can at one of my cat and press the shutter down 1 2 way the can focus and the ready light blink i press the rest of the way the flash go off and the can save the pick i go back to the playback and the pick come up on screen it work smile so i get a work one and in good shape too only a little dust inside the lens ti ame to expert agent smile we will first the main speck of the can and i ll mention where today lie resolution 1280x960 make this a 1 imp can actual chip resolution 850x984 or 836 400 pipe so in fact this be not a megapixel can a today clay amid ah we will for me no big deal a i already know this memory build in 2 mb also take cf card up to at least 128 mb that i test 24 bite color depth iso equivalent of iso 160 so it be just about a good all around can x optical room no digital room auto focus 2 3 ft to infinity use in for rouse close up focus 0 7 foot to 1 6 foot 0 2 to 0 5 m room length mmm to 114 mm 35 mm can equivalent actual local length mmm to 21 mm flash range on wide 2 3 ft to 16 4 foot on tell 2 3 ft to 10 8 foot aperture wide f 2 5 to f 16 tell f 3 8 to f 24 shutter speed one of the thing i like 1 500th to 16 second great for night shoot viewfinder boom optical now like i say i only get the can nothing else but i do have card reader for cf card so no big i put the card in to the reader and check the pick today use a different picture file format here it end with a do it be actually a form of pg i know because the he photosmart printer we have at work will let you see the pick but on the it look flurry minor difference make it unstable this way right from the can normally i d have be stick without the conversion software today us but luckily you can do it from today or use any other program that read do format his not shop pro 7 doe a doe irfanview for example the can save all pick in the 1280x960 resolution interpolate them up from 850x960 so they look a little soft not sharp a little reside to 850x637 which be what they be when you try to match the resolution horizontal without look the aspect ratio help to sharpen the pick up a doe use the sharpen control of your favorite photo editor once you save the file a a pg or whatever you like i find that irfanview s sharpen filter or photoshops sharp mask work best make the pick unable for web and also print up to x depend on the pick i have be take this can everywhere with me along with my other new can my toshiba per 3300 3 2 up they both have good and bad side and work we will a a comb the dc120 will focus in any light even darkness since it us in the toshiba us edge detection so the subject ha to have some light on it for focus this can be not hard to use once you figure the control out it can be use 1 hand once you set the room there be a hand strap on the right side like a camcorder keep the can on your hand we will you would not use the viewscreen on back to set up the shoot you can but it work good if you would not and save battery there be some bad part to this can for one it be a discontinue can so no support really from today 2 you have to buy them use so who know what condition they will be in but the price be usually good there can be defect on the can for example mine ha a slight problem with hot pipe show up on dark photo hot pipe look like white speak in the pick not a major probe unless take pick of a starry sky smile mine also ha dust inside the lens so far i do not think it be affect the pick when take pick in the high quality mode it take about 10 second to save the pick and be ready for the next one so it be a bite slow just plan your shoot right smile some feature i like and also make me get one of these we be when shoot close up mode the display come on when you hold the shutter down 1 2 way let you see the pick good than use the viewfinder also when in close up mode you mentally focus the can use the room button also show the distance focus for on the little lead this be the only ti ame the can ha manual focus but i still like it i like the shape of it it be the size of a good size paperback novel and you use it look down the long part of the can like binoculars sort of it be not a heavy can ha a big lens let in more light it seem and i be tell it us a cod i amaze chip a oppose to a co chip like the cheap come now use allow for good color reproduction i have get some very nice picture from this can you can still get add on lens and filter for this can use and new check with stiffen i love the in focus system hasn t really fail me yet and seem right on the money when it focus now do not get me wrong this can be not a good a my toshiba per 3300 for serious picture the 3 2 up i damage be very sharp but it make a nice and can replace my other come i review in previous opinion for the most part i for one be very happy with this can and would suggest that anyone interest in a very expensive can to play around

234;Auto;when i look at this ride i can not call it a car i feel like he be say to me that he will take every challenge it look like nothing but power and gun the nose alone now some extra hole in it and a large wide open spread mouth give it an eager appearance the back also look quite i impressive with it be 4 huge exhaust pipe and the subtle fine wave in the coach work turn it into a beauty for sure of course this powerful look ha to be support by superior technique this wa also take care of the 5 6 litre along with some other adjustment provide an increase of capacity from 300 to a heavy 380 he and with a spring to 100 km h in 6 second and a peak of 250 km h this beautiful monster be definitely one of the fat boy of the class this however still doe not make it into a sport wagon therefore he be way to big the i immense engine room be not only embellish by a splendid ve but also through various advance electronic system it ha a traction control system which recall the clutch if a wheel would run on one push on the button of the em right next to the six gear box make the ve react totally different to the accelerate everything be a bite more supple this able the pilot to dose the power even more accurately ideal for start stop traffic it be just not suitable to pull up with almost spin wheel because you accidentally push the pedal a bite too far because with so much horse power the difference between fast and very very fast be a fraction of a mill after another advantage be the fuel compensation be a bite more within the li admit but if you can afford this ride it should not count a special structure take care of a pleasurable behavior in the turn because the back wheel steer along with the rest naturally you will find all kind off luxury in this expensive ride this model ha beautiful leather interior of sport seat and because the back seat offer almost no room for the leg you can put it down to transport even more luggage a rare practical detail for this type of ride all in you should definitely ride once in this one

242;Camera;in the quest to provide learn experience for my student i wa introduce to the sonya mavra line of digital camera in case you be not up on the late news regard the state of public education there be little money in the budget for this sort of tool however because i often use the technology of the computer and presentation software in my classroom this item become a must have i purchase the ff 83 for my personal use but like many other teacher i use it in the classroom it be very si ample to use it ha great probability and due to the medium it us to capture i damage a standard 3 5 floppy disk it be a resource that can be utilize by several student during a class period my student use both the still i damage function a we will a the peg function to create a community service project ai amid at help student new to middle school adjust the kiss quickly figure out which picture they could take and i immediately put to use the bonus that the mavra offer wa that a disk could be eject and the camera wa i immediately ready for another student to use in addition the i damage capture on disk by the first student we be ready a we will go be the day of download that take long than the research for a paper of project the pp mode disk pose no problem for our apple computer and graphiconverter the video transfer we will and respond we will a a facet of a presentation piece use hyperstudio the camera also offer several filter with which one can alter picture while still in the camera if one be dissatisfy with the filter septum and black and white be two of them one can remove them the black and white option come in quite handy when put part of a presentation on paper to be photocopy the disk copy tool be invaluable when one want to be sure that the picture be in more than one place with this option one can copy from one i damage to the entire disk of i damage in le than two minute and without any extra equipment this epi laminate the quit my partner be absent quit dilemma which many teacher face in group work the floppy medium also save a great deal of class ti ame a i do not need to download a memory card a i once do each floppy disk hold up to 40 i damage use the standard resolution a bonus when work with student however this number drop practically when the resolution be fine a floppy only retain 7 fine resolution i damage the peg function will record up to one minute of video and that us all of the space on the floppy i have find that one can overrule the 5 10 and 15 second present ti jam for video capture if one si amply continue to depress the operate button past the present ti ame the camera will continue to record up to 60 continuous second the resolution be more than adequate for the i damage that my student take and it be often quite good belie it be low fix ratio

244;Camera;comparison i compare five be camera before settle on the union 5400 film wise i ve double with photography for quite a while start with an polypus a and i ve have a canon o 1000f sir for 12 year i buy an polypus d 540l some ti ame ago which be 0 him camera it be take some nice pick but a you be probably aware these will not print out at more than 3 x 2 since film photography be expensive and frustration if you would not have your own development equipment digital photography be the way to go my opinion be you need a 4 be camera to replace a mmm camera full manual overrule be a must a we will the camera i look at canon go sonya ve polypus c5050 union 5700 union 5400 a good way to compare feature be to go to http www review com the buy guide menu and choose side by side a lot of the feature be si similar and it be pretty close these day between the manufacturer visual quality of the camera be i improve at a mark rate and it be difficult to choose between them here the camera do have certain feature that have pro and son and this be where you wouldraw your final conclusion here be my summary of the 5 camera list above canon go when you hold this in the shop next to the 5400 and ve it feel like a brick it be large and bulky but all the feature be easily accessible and it doe not feel fiddle personally i think this ha the bad artifact out of all the camera list above colour balance and tone be great but if you look at the resolution test on companion you will see that diagonal be please and there be slight green fringe to black edge conclusion i decide against this camera because of it be size and artifact sonya ve this be the most compact of the above camera and for ha the massive plus of a carl le lens i use to have an polypus a which wa a compact point and click mmm camera which also have a carl le lens i think it take some of the best picture i ve ever take look at the result on this site this camera take excellent picture and sonya seem to have sort out the colour balance on this model it be nice and compact and ha an automatic lens cover which be a nice feature it be size be both a plus and a minus though if you have large hand i do not think you will like this camera it be not easy to hold it ha some interest feature like you cannonade picture in complete darkness use it be infra red mode it will also focus perfectly in the dark compare to the other camera be be quite cheap but then you have to use more expensive sonya memory card and you have to buy sonya attachment e g external flash this be the only camera which doe not have movable screen and you will wish you would have one once you have have a camera that ha this feature conclusion i decide against this camera because it wa so awkward to hold in the shop and the venus seem a bite fiddle to select option set also it doe not have a movable view screen and you must buy sonya accessory polypus c5050 this camera be the old of the one above i believe i ve be quite i impress with my old polypus 540l despite it be low resolution and age i think it take pretty good picture i think polypus be a little underrate personally a sonya union and canon seem to get all the attention this camera be suppose to be very good in low light and i like twilight photography so i do consider this camera it feel good in your hand take photo and the i damage quality be excellent just look at the companion conclusion i decide against this model a it be be out quite a while and i think the i amaze software ha move on since then it move at a very rapid pace the review point out some arifacts and i d rather not have those despite get at recommend rat union 5700 this camera get good review it feel nice to hold it ha good functionality and take excellent photo it ha an x optical room which be fantastic but because of this the camera feel more like an sir a it large than the others this camera be more expensive than the others but ha all their feature and the room conclusion if you want a camera with big room i d look at some of the cheap polypus model there be an old maxim be in photography if you want to room in on a subject move close to it if you get a big room and you would not have good light you be just go to get camera shake you even start to notice it on some of the x and x room model this be a great camera but just not quite what i wa look for union 5400 i think this ha the same body a the 5700 but with a 28 116mm equivalent lens when i have my canon o 1000f it come with a 35 mmm lens i soon change this for a 28 mmm lens because more often than not you use wide angle than room when you would need room 3 or 4 ti jam be plenty you rarely need x or six optical room and when you would you can sacrifice a little quality and do it digital so a you can probably tell this sell the camera to me other than that the camera feel great to hold ha a good rubber grip and you can practically operate it with one hand the fold out screen be excellent and allow you to lift it up high or down on the grind and still see what you be take conclusion wide angle lens with x room good to hold and excellent i damage i will say this camera be a little slow to process you photo once take and be not great at fuss in really bad light summary we will i hope this information ha be useful to you this be the kind of review i wa look for when try to decide what to purchase if you be bud photo enthusiast and you take a lot of photo and like to expert agent with your camera i would avoid the sonya a it be very fiddle just try it in a shop it also ha no fold out screen which also mean it could get scratch a it ha a soft plastic cover i take it this be the main difference why this camera be cheap all the other camera be much nice to handle although the 5700 be large i like to go out on my bike and take photo and the 5700 will not fit in a large jacket waterproof pocket whereas the others will the polypus c5050 and canon go probably take the bad photo of the 5 due to noise and arise in the i damage the union be more expensive but feel like good solid camera and have all the feature you will ever need the union camera be the most expensive but you can get good comparative deal if you shop around you will read in a number of review that the 5400 low light focus be a little sketch although it ha to be pretty low light the thing that cell it be the wide angle go out and take some panorama shoot with it or interior and you will be sell my i impression of use the union 5400 i be very happy with the picture from my 5400 grant it be a big leap up from the polypus model i have before i be have great fun with ti ame lapse photography and shutter priority meet be excellent on this camera i ve have it a couple of week now and take 1000 picture and i still feel i be only scratch the surface of all the feature definitely get a 256mb card if you get one of these camera do not frustrate yourself with anything le copy 256mb onto a pp take about 5 10 mind over u i think you can get flash reader which might be fast than this it be still not a long ti ame though consider the amount of data my 540l would take 20 mind to do limb over the aerial link you can pretty much work the 5400 with one hand the deal be excellent and i would not buy a camera that doe not have dial mode elector after have my canon o 1000f i find the rear mount curse button too low the rear control should be far up the camera to be more comfortable with the button in an arc around the curse follow the sweep of your thumb the rubber grip be good though and it be comfortable to take lot of photo the fold out screen be a big plus although a little small i take it you have to compromise in order to have good battery life if you be use the camera a lot in one day it will be lucky to see the day out so you should invest in a second battery these take 2 hour to fully charge with the charge provide software that come with the camera be pretty good the union view camera software be fully feature and scaleable will work comfortably whatever the power of your pp you can do just about anything to a photo with the photoshop element package that it come with that be real fun and why digital photography be definitely the future i have an hp5550 photo printer which give great result a we will note get a printer which print full page a the 5550 ha a white border for best result you should go to a professional printer where they will have 20 grand professional printer you get good result enjoy nick
245;Camera;my wife be an aid mmm camera buff and be still not sell on digital photography we will i come across a good deal on a polaroid do 1300 camera and despite some shortcoming i be quite i impress of what you get for the price first of all window up user may be a bite frustrate the camera will not work with the si ample and easy to use build in digital camera software that work so we will with manner and other input device so you have to install the polaroid software though a incompatibility wizard it install but i wa unable to use the u cord so i have to go with the much slow seem like it imperial plug a good solution would be to spend a little extra money and get a universal compactflash reader that work like a disk device in window up make it much easy now on to the camera it take really good picture they be clear and crisp at all resolution the only bad picture i have wa when i wa take picture outside at dusk they seem to be quite dull there be not an adequate room on the camera so you really have to move in to fill the frame the lead screen and the menu option work quite we will and be an add bonus for the low cost to the camera the include software be pretty basic but if basic be what you want up s software be much easy and fast to use window 95 98 me user will have no problem instal the software the camera consume the battery quite quickly so be sure to turn it off when not in use the lead screen also eat a lot of power when the battery be low there really be no warn and when you go to take a picture it will flash and then turn off i would recommend take a pocketful of battery with you on trip it also include a u and aerial cord a protective case and an 8 meg card i would recommend get at least a 32 meg card overall if you can find this camera for under 200 00 it be a great price and very good for basic use those want more feature be good off with one with more bell and whistle

249;Camera;this be a good digital camera for someone want to get into digital photography it be easy to use the shape and feel of the camera be very much like a traditional non digital point and shoot a you might expect from today the i damage themselves be quite good the big downfall of this camera be that there be no optical room the digital room be difficult to use since it be not optical you have to use the display screen when shoot with it to see what you will really get you can not tell by use the viewfinder this make it quite difficult for outdoor shoot where the screen can be tough to see the camera will also go through the battery power more quickly when use the display screen and even at only x the room make the picture quite grain and pixelated so i pretty much give up on use it and consider it to be a camera with no room the dx3600 be not much more but it doe have an optical room not much but enough to make it much more useful than the 3500 my suggestion if you get this camera be to not use the room even if it look like it would make a good shoot instead shoot without it then crop the photo late on your pp you will avoid the pixelation problem and if you shoot at the high resolution you will still have a decent size photo especially if it be for share via the web or e mail but even small print will be okay also be aware that replace the battery can get expensive i suggest purchase a charge and rechargable battery pack that doe of course offset one of the nice benefit of this camera the price i use this camera for a few week then sell it on bay and use the money for a dx3600 you can find both model regularly on bay a factory return although most we be probably never even use but do not get too carry away with the bid a i ve see some of them go for almost the price of new one
250;Camera;the other review have cover this camera quite we will so i would just like to add a little bite of my own insight 1 bulk the camera be a lot bulky than most digital however i like the feel of a mmm so this camera suite me we will if you want an easy to carry all around camera this be not it however if you like the feel and leave of a traditional mmm this camera might suite you too 2 the 2 5 inch lead be awesome my old 1 6 really stick compare to this one 3 disk can be interchange at anti ame i buy a 10 pack of mind d r s and initiative all of them at once they only take a few second each and then i have storage for about 600 to 3000 photo s depend on your resolution set 4 what be with stiff i do not know of any online store that will except stiff file and they be enormous they should switch to raw if they want an compress format on the camera 5 they would not really offer a wide array of lens for the camera just a few basis for a serious amateur or pro this might be an issue also you need an adapt ring to use them 6 the battery can not be charge outside the camera unless you want to buy a special charge from sonya for around 60 if you want a spare you have to take out the one in the camera then insert the spare to charge it charge spare battery pain in a 7 menu s be easy and logical lay out it only take a few minute to master the menu s on this camera sonya ha do an excellent job in this department otherwise i love the camera it take sharp clear i damage and depend on the resolution set it doe not take that long to burn them to d this camera ha a x d drive an x might be a nice i improvement battery life be good consider you be low a mind computer also i take a tip from another review and buy some of those pad screen protector i cut it to fit over the lead work great protect the lead and i damage be still crystal clear

it possible for precede bend to build a counter yes virginia m b be indeed capable of build a counter we know because we own one we lease a new 1999 my 320 in october 1998 and we be i immediately surprise by some very un precede like battle squeaky and shake the my felt much loose than our other sport utility vehicle a 1997 deep grand cherokee this come a something of a shock consider how often precede be praise in the car magazine for it be solid body structure and vault like feel after about a month the battle squeaky and shake we be join by a rush wind noise from the rear watch which grow steadily in intensity over the next few week until the interior of our vehicle at highway speed sound like a 747 blast down the runaway at full thrust another surprise await u at the car wash where the rear cargo compartment get thoroughly soak because of the poor seal around the watch door good thing we we be not sleep any grocery back there at the ti ame i do not have anything against wax bean but i be not sure how taste cannula d veggie might be when we take the my to the dealer to look at the problem the service manager point out that the watch door wa stick up about an inch above the roofline ha the vehicle be in a crash he ask add that he have never see such a badly misalign door that wa not the result of a collision the dealer replace the weather strip around the watch and realize the door which fix the problem temporarily the wind noise return several month late we we be perplex by the poor quality of our vehicle but never have own a precede before we would not know if the rattle wa something that plague all mr or just ours then we wouldrove the dealer s my 320 loafer while ours wa in the shop for the first of what would be many many extend visit we we

out here that the loafer my wa the so call elegance version which include leather upholstery a sunroof and other amenity while our my be the le expensive classic version with cloth seat and no sunroof mechanically however the two version be identical we subsequently drive yet another dealer own my 320 elegance which wa also rattle free why then do our my rattle and squeaky like a bad accord in an oompah band we conclude that our vehicle somehow slip off m b s new assembly line in tuscaloosa alabama without anyone catch the defect it happen any assembly line produce it be share of defect and reject when you consider that m b wa still work out the kind in a brand new factory at the ti ame our vehicle wa build not to mention struggle to keep up with the surge demand for the m series it be not inconceivable that one shoe specie amen slip through but you will never get precede bend to admit that a regional service manager send to inspect our car conclude that the rattle wa cause by defective door hinge hardware which wa replace under warranty the door no long rattle but the rest of the body still doe the vehicle shudder violently when go over even modest pothole or bump the

the dealer try and fail repeatedly to fix the engine senior problem that cause the light to go on in the first place it wa finally fix after about four or five trip to the dealer we almost miss the warm amber glow of the check engine light that ha be our constant drive companion all these month oh and do i mention that one of the headlamp burn out after le than 40 000 kilometre about 25 000 mile so naturally precede bend keeper of the quality faith i immediately send a team of expert to examine our vehicle in microscopic detail in order to learn how such an aberration could possibly have pass out the factory gate right up no the idea that precede be somehow more genuinely concern about quality than other corporation be a fantasy that we gullible folk in consumerland have be condition to believe by all the company s glossy advertise and careful cultivation of it be brand cachet the reality be that precede bend be an arrogant corporation that doe not care any more about it be customer

process when we point out that we feel create after pay full price for a defective vehicle they say they would be happy to fix it but not replace it we now look forward to make a few dozen more trip to the dealer maybe they would not mind if i pitch a tent and sleep bag in their showroom see a i spend so much ti ame there it would just be so much more practical than commute back and forth every day all in all precede bend ha some major work to do if it intend to compete effectively in the mid price segment it be now pursue with vehicle like the m series the company s strategy of make it be

anymore so i realize that there we be only a few option open to me either dump it in my drawer and forget about it only to be take out when absolutely necessary or trade it in for one of the new generation of digital camera while it wa still worth something what exactly we be those irritate trait i hear you ask the number one failure for me wa it be dismal battery life take a couple of picture stroll through your shoot to decide which one be keeper and which one to delete and before you know it the screen be dead due to a dead battery the other main downfall for me wa the way the union engineer have set up the option menu concern the self ti ame and close up feature viz that you could have the one or the other but not both this wa a big no no for me a i especially need the ti ame feature while take highly magnify close up shoot of watch movement see a it be almost i impossible to depress the shutter without even a tiny amount of camera movement the ti ame feature would have come in handy have it be an option we will it wa an option just not one to be use si simultaneously with the close up feature fortunately a friend at work wa keen on buy my 950 so now the prospect of get the 995 wa make much more unfordable the main reason that i do not change band but decide to stick with the union wa that i absolutely love the incredibly sharp and bright picture of the former regardless of whether they we be take in the regular mode or use micro so how doe the 995 stick up against it be old generation sit here be a brief renown keep in mind what my main us of the camera be which be for close up of watch and watch part and general family picture b the good b picture quality be still excellent with the add benefit of have x room versus x for the new generation model mmm to mmm v mmm to mmm in the area of sharpness contrast definition and situation of color it seem to be at least a good a the 950 which have an excellent reputation for be outstanding in those area to be honest i can not really tell if one be good than the other a i would need a professional quality printer to be able to give you an absolute answer my printer a new canon s300 2400 x 1200 dip be only good enough to show me that they seem to be at least comparable and certainly excellent enough to satisfy the most demand user micro be unchanged still an amaze cm be the close rouse distance flash be now a pop up unit so red eye while not entirely epi laminate be greatly reduce the pop up style flash also ha the add advantage in that it be automatically off until you wouldeliberately pop it up the push and rotate set up to access the different venus and option be very easy logical and straightforward to use and oh yes battery life ha be greatly extend about two hour of continuous use versus about 10 minute for it be predecessor while i wish that union would put in a separate button or switch for the self ti ame at least now one can use the close up feature together with it the downside be that the self ti ame only operate in the close up mode which mean that the auto rouse be much fine and hence slow versus the regular mode the quick review function be really handy especially consider the delay between the ti ame the shutter be press and the picture be actually take so one can see whether one make the shoot or not and if so whether it be a keeper or not b the bad b no complex not from me this ti ame about inadequate documentation this be a company that obviously listen to their customer the instruction booklet be complete and for those require large print the complete manual be available on the supply from while i wa amaze at the brightness and resolution of the 950 s view screen i be not too enthusiastic about the one on the 995 not only be it a little small 4 cm versus cm but a lot le bright and regardless of how i adjust the view option low resolution especially in low light condition oh we will i guess that be the price user have to pay for the greatly extend battery life i have a speak suspicion that that the amaze view screen wa the main culprit for the 950 s dismal battery life this be still not a camera for sport aficionado due to the delay from the ti ame the shutter be release till the ti ame the shoot be actually take in fact there be still so much law that one will probably find this camera inadequate for candid shoot especially if your child be anywhere near a active a mine i honestly do not think that this be just a shortcoming of union digital camera in general or this one in particular but of all digital camera due to the way they work i think that it will be a few more year before digital camera will be able to match regular film camera in the area of speed when you see the sport action photographer go digital then you will know that they have overcome that weakness the viewfinder be still not much to write home about but i realize that if union we be to give it a true through the lens viewfinder both the cost and size would increase dramatically this final criticism be not really a serious one but now one ha so many option that when one school through the different venus some have more than one page read the instruction and just practice go through them to get comfortable and familiar with all of them and how to switch between them in order to see how intuition the camera be to use i manage to figure them all out without read the instruction booklet to all of my friend and family whom i have chime in the past for not read the instruction i humbly apologize a the say go when all else fail read the instruction b the ugly b while still not an attractive camera by any mean the canon each win that award hand down the wife feature definitely make the camera easy to hold firmly and mind mile it be bulk while not in use the 995 doe not have the same metal body a the 950 so it doe give the i impression of be le solid build than the latter although my experience ha be that the polycarbonate type of plastic that the camera manufacturer use be very tough on the plus side it doe have the add advantage of reduce the camera weight b a few i important manufacturer specification b i cod i 28 mmm cod capable of 3 34 million pipe i i damage size i 640x480 va pipe to 2048x1536 pipe full i lens i ff x room mmm to mmm approve lately mmm to

dimension i 138mm x mmm x mmm i weight i 390g sans battery i battery i rechargeable li ion supply with both one battery and the charge which double a an ac adapt final think b although the 995 come with a u cable to hook it up directly to one s come i still prefer to use a card reader a it free up the camera for other us couple with the fact that i do not need to delete the camera s battery or hook up the ac adapt a i mention in my 950 review even although the price of meg storage card have fall dramatically i be still not a fan of them for the reason give i use either a limb or limb compact flash card maybe i would be more keen on them if i print large photo a i do not print anything large than 8 x 10 i do not need the high resolution hence no need for massive storage card all in all i be very happy with my purchase and even although i amiss the incredible clarity of the 950 s view screen i be please that i make the upgrade email me for any far question or comment mary

269;Camera;i buy the sonya duc pp while stay in more during the world cup and i must admit it be really fancy after the initial charge of the include battery i have ton of fun try out the pp s many feature especially the movie aspect let me start off by tell you the picture quality you have many to choose from but because the include limb memory stick wa small i do not use the maxim alum set because when i do i wa only able to fit in about 12 pick but set the camera 1280x960 i wa able to fit in 33 picture which be ok and the quality be very decent a we will the menu set allow you to have a lot of control over what you want although you can not mentally set the aperture set but that be ok because this camera wa mean for people like me who do not know or even want to know how to mentally set these thing the night shoot work ok i do have some trouble at first but overall the camera do work we will in very dark situation you just have to remember to hold the camera very still since the lens be open for a long period of ti ame which mean that any type of movement will distort the i damage the flash be very bright but it doe take the camera a bite long than i would like for it to charge between take picture roughly 4 6 second some jam up to 10 depend on how much battery power you have leave also the flash eat the battery power very quickly the room on the camera which be digital x work very we will good than i have see on most digital camera within this range now onto the fun stuff the move picture portion for the camera be really good you cannonade full motion move at 320x240 and unlike many other camera you can make a long a the movie you want with sound up to the storage space on the memory stick with the include memory stick you can get 11 minute worth although the quality be not that great but it be fun to use at ti jam another nice feature be the multishot in lieu of the movie this be where the camera will take a series of picture with one click it be really fun to play with now the cause of the camera be really great it feel solid in my hand and unlike other camera that have the plastic feel this one be more rugged because of it be aluminium allow body it be light yet sturdy and it cannonade a beat i drop my camera a few ti jam during some heat moment at the world cup but it keep on go although i do not suggest you would this of course a great feature of all digital camera be the lead display the p 9 sport a great 1 5 lead that be bright and crisp even in the outdoor where most other camera seem to without the navigation be do by a rocket button which can be a haste for anyone with big finger but it multi lately be a great piece of design the only down fall i have with the lead be that it be not a touchscreen when review picture you be able to room into the picture and edit on board such a drop rotate and boom in and out of the picture all within the camera the clarity even at 1280x960 be unbeleivable i take a picture of some history tablet while visit the museum and use the room i wa able to read every single word in the picture without have to take picture of each section that wa really great the camera be unbeleivable especially when use a 128mb memory stick i be able to fit over 300 picture at the 1280x960 mode and 112 at the high set which be 2392x1400 i generally use the landscape mode this be one great camera i ve take a look at other 4 megapixel camera and but this wa the only one that have a great design and sturdy feel i try the minorca which look si similar to the p 9 but it felt weak and it felt a if i would have to be very careful when take picture which be not always the case sonya ha do great thing with the duc p series of camera s and they know when they have a killer design along with fantastic feature and this one be no different the 4 megapixel quality should last for a few year and i know it will last since i put it through the battle of the world cup

278;Camera;i buy my polypus c2020 room digital camera in late january 2000 for about 900 after add a strap to prevent lens cap loss i ve lose 2 so far even with the strap a battery charge and an extra memory card my total cost wa over 1050 lot of feature i be still learn to use them all it be great to not worry about waste a lot of film i just ease bad picture shoot away be get pretty good result see http community webshots com user melhouse1 for example even use the camera s programme set good sharp detail in micro mode a we will the camera s small size make it convenient to take along but it ha some minor design flaw some of which have be fix in the new c3000 line c4000 line of this camera these flaw include 1 easily lose lens cap i ve only lose one so far it cost 18 to replace 2 neck strap attachment ring in a bad position so when wear around the neck the camera tip up rather than sit comfortably against the chest 3 some camera feature require stroll through several venus to access or be difficult to find in the venus 4 no u my printer ha a build in memory card reader so this be not really a problem for me have have instance where the camera doe not properly register color particularly when attempt to photograph close up or bunch of red flower such a rise variation begonia etc or in incandescent light although late version of this camera supposedly have i approve color process have find that it be a bite inconvenient awkward to have to use an adapt ring in order to use filter i also feel this ring should have come standard with the camera rather than a an add on overall though i be happy with the camera when the new i approve version of this camera come down in price i be give this one to my daughter get a new model
279;Camera;i buy this camera because i just have my first son and think this would be the easy way to get his new picture out to relative in a short period of ti ame what i do not take into effect be rouse this camera suck for rouse and when you put it on your computer you totally need to render the photo to make it photo quality that will look good on your printer and even with render the picture be usually still all flurry and tend to be too grain anyway here be my chief complex not 1 the view finder screen make rouse mentally i impossible give the terrible resolution of the screen 2 in the dark you be completely screw unless you have some sort of large light with which to light your subject yes there be a flash but it be no good unless your i damage be focus and yes the autofocus ha no idea what to do with a dark subject the flash tend to make the picture way too bright also 3 the battery life be pathetic each disk hold 40 picture the only problem be the battery usually doe not last through all of them the good thing about the mavra be 1 the disc combatability although i be not quite sure why they would not go all out to the memory stick a sonya keep say they want to do overall i guess the new mavra s be good but they still rely on bad rouse technology which inevitably li admit the mavra s usefulness to the point of say thank but no thank br br

281;Camera;after search a ton of digital camera my husband call me and say isn have this one on and to take a look at it i wa a little weary a i have have problem with 2 other digital camera and them work with my machine computer and window me i think we will i will not know till i try it i wa pleasantly surprise when the installation go without a pitch from instal software to take picture i wa look for a 2 megapixel camera for pick of our family that i could enlarge up to an 8 x 10 with 35 mm quality this be it i usually take pick without the screen on a this doe oris note battery fast i have not find a problem with the battery drain fast with regular usage and use the viewfinder the menu screen be very easy to use a matter of use arrow which i hope we all understand the top of the camera be very si ample to understand it ha an icon for take a picture one for view the pick and one for video not difficult at all the camera be lightweight and perfect for my hand a we will a that of my husband who ha large hand our daughter almost 4 yes old take pick for me and they be beautiful she know that when the light be green to take the pick and when it be orange to wait a matter of second the self ti ame be a nice addition a we often want a family pick take and no one around to take it i have recently use this in the rain on our daughter s field trip also i would not recommend get it too wet the rain wa come down and it wa dark and miserable and the pick be beautiful the color stand out wonderfully the memory card be not expensive any more mine come with a 16 mb card i believe and i cannonade 100 pick on it i always take pick in the fine resolution so i can get the best photo quality out of each shoot it be nice to have removable memory a you can buy a big or small memory a you need ex 8 my or 128 mb i be plan on buy a 16 or 32 mb card a a back so i can continue shoot without have to delete any pick i also like the fact that there be no double press the button to take the pick some digital require you to press and hold or press twice this one you press and hold if you want to or just press and it take the shoot the only thing i have trouble with at first be take pick without any shake my regular 35 mm camera be bulky so i wa use to that weight however after maybe 3 shoot that we be shake my pick begin to get good and good with no shake what whoever i have use the digital room to look at the picture on the screen but have not develop any that i have leave in the room mode a i be usually close enough to the subject or background i be take a picture of i have unload picture to palmar on their webster and have the exact same picture develop off of my memory card to see if the photo quality be the same i think that the palmar one would be nice in case i be not up to go out 8 most pg and with a 4 or old i must say that the unload pick we be the same quality a the one directly off my memory the only difference be if you take the memory in with you the photo people can brighten dark or balance any color in the picture which be nice if you be enlarge them etc unfortunately i have have my camera fall of my desk about 5 ti jam and so far not a scratch no problem with the camera at all i have use the movie section a few ti jam and love it take a few minute to unload the video but it be great the only thing i cannothink of a a con be not really a con i tend to take too many picture and then fire out the cost of 100 pick thank goodness the price have come down to about 26 cent a picture full be know for their film quality and their digital camera quality a far a color depth etc they wouldefinitely out do themselves on this camera
282;Auto;i buy my 1990 galant be in may of 1990 from doe brother mitsubishi in memphis to the car wa virtually identical to the model that have will note 1989 motor trend i import car of the year award the 4 door sedan i purchase wa equip with a 2 0 late 16 valve donc engine that produce 130 he the transmission wa a 5 speed manual feature include driver adjustable suspension be be sterno cassette a c and quit sport seat quit the car wa mark a a sport sedan and wa highly rout by the automobile press i very nearly buy a turn or carry but i really want a more sport car with a 5 speed stick when my galant wa relatively new and before the constant problem start this vehicle wa a joy to drive it look good felt good and make me feel smart for have purchase it the ride wa fairly quiet and the engine accelerate smoothly almost to the 7000 rum realize the first problem do not bother me at all for instance in the first year a vacuum those problem cause the fancy suspension system to fail but this wa easily repair i always strictly follow the his notenance schedule specify by the owner s manual doe mitsubishi perform all routine his notenance with the exception of oil change which we be do quarterly at various 15 minute oil change shop i think it wa unusual when the battery go dead in my second year of ownership the inside dome light have be on all night because one of the door do not shut completely this cause the battery to go completely dead it turn out that mitsubishi have instal extremely cheap battery a standard equipment no they we be not cover by the vehicle warranty 3 year 50 000 mile i buy myself a big heavy 5 year battery at autozone that wa about twice the size of the original battery my first major problem occur at about 53 000 mile in 1993 the car go completely dead one saturday morning when i wa about a mile from home on monday the doe repair shop call to tell me that my ti among belt have break and it have cause severe damage to the engine they est amaze repair to be in the 2000 3000 range incidentally the owner s manual specify that ti among belt on the galant do not require replacement until 60 000 mile however they offer to rebuild the valve cylinder a a warranty job for free if i would let them keep the car for 10 14 day and use the repair job a a teach tool naturally i quickly and gratefully accept that offer i continue my strict observance of the publish his notenance schedule the next major problem happen at 97 000 mile when the second ti among belt break this second belt have last only 44 000 mile the doe repair shop inform me that i would need a new engine which they would provide for 5 000 they would only consider put in a brand new engine by this ti ame the car even if repair to perfection wa not worth 5 000 i argue that the damage should have be cover by warranty because the ti among belt wa still 16 000 mile shy of be due for replacement neither doe nor mitsubishi corporate felt bind by the guideline publish in the vehicle his notenance schedule i strongly suspect that doe wa try to pressure me into trade for a new car i refuse see no point in ever again use doe or mitsubishi s service i have the car bow to merit motor an independent repair shop after several day of look they locate a use 2 0 late donc mitsubishi engine which they instal for me for about 2200 total the car wa run but it would never quite be the same axis note last few year of ownership we be a constant battle with oil lead unstable engine idle set smoke exhaust fear of break ti among belt which we change every 18 month or 30 000 mile on board computer failure and electrical failure that include a battery explosion i keep the galant for 9 year and 140 000 mile an indication of my stubbornness rather than quality or reliability of the vehicle in case you have a doubt i will never buy from another doe own leadership again neither will i purchase another mitsubishi automobile again i ll steer clear of their to s v s and other gear too note most galant sell in 1990 we be the be variety with a she engine i suspect the be model have much good reliability than the be mitsubishi sell a lot of early 1990s eclipse that have the same donc engine a my galant i have observe that very very few we be still on the road just a few year late br br

i have a good friend who cell and distribute photographic equipment he provide me with tip about digital camera that be real bargain model that be sell and perform very we will and occasionally about blunder and model to avoid this advice be a great help to me because i work very hard to make my camera review a good a they can be have a friend in the industry give me access to information that be not usually available to the general public photography magazine have a vest interest advertise from camera photo equipment manufacturer make up the great part of their income in put a positive spin on every model and accessory that they test my friend let me in on what be usually know only to industry insider his late tip wa about what a tremendous bargain sonya s new cybershot duc s digital camera be it turn out that he have one return by a local photographer who ha be shoot mmm for more than thirty year this guy buy the sonya cybershot duc s after read a very positive photo may review he wa really disappoint when the i damage we be not a good a those he wa use to get with slow speed mmm slide film he also complain about all the i damage have a pinkish cast since the gentleman ha always be a good customer my friend allow hi be to return the camera my friend ha be carry the s around for about a week and he ask me if i would like join hi be on a photographic out to test the camera s white balance which could have be the cause of the pinkish cast and it be overall performance before he send it back to sonya i be always ready to drop everything and go play with a new camera even when it be cold a he will outside louisville ha finally get a little winter weather the past couple of week so i have be avoid any unnecessary trip outside however the opportunity to check out a new four megapixel digital camera make me forget how cold it wa we get together early saturday afternoon and spend about two hour shoot street i damage along bardstown road in the highland we then make a quick trip into cherokee park to shoot some winter shoot along beargrass creek the s do an admirable job with the static shoot of the ice bind creek but wa not completely up to the job of hit the decisive moment in our street photography effort digital camera do not usually perform very we will in action photography set sport street shoot and wildlife photography remain beyond the capability of most digital camera because of shutter law and start up cycle write record ti jam the s s shutter law be pretty short for a four megapixel camera but the start up cycle ti ame law be a bite long than average we take along a union fa with a 35 1 4 his nikkor and a 105 2 d of micro nikkor to shoot comparison i damage the fa wa load with iso 100 today elitechrome slide film after we finish at beargrass creek we return to my friend s and set up a small area with a white backdrop and a light box to shoot some close up and check the white balance capability of the s the one button white balance feature work we will and we we be not able to duplicate the pinkish cast that my friend customer have complain about we shoot a large fruit basket my friend have get a a christmas gift from one of his supplier the weave traffic basket contain two naval orange two huge bright red apple some mean in the she will and three bright mint green year the fruit basket make an absolutely perfect photo subject and the i damage we be almost fruitless the s s meet do an exceptional job of get the exposure right in both auto and aperture priority mode the color we be a bite over saturate but very accurate louisville receive between two and three inch of fresh snow over night and when we get together just before noon on sunday we head straight for cherokee park to shoot some winter wonderland stuff in the wood while the white stuff wa till new and print we go to dog hill louisville s premier shed venue to shoot leader the new snow wa soft and wet make for some blaze fast lead run down the long steep hill the s wa not able to lock on and capture decent shoot of the fast move seed many of the leader we be dress in very bright color and we we be able to shoot them easily with the fa load with today iso 100 color print film and both the 35 1 4 and the 105 2 8 once the cold start to be a little bite painful we return to my friend s place and he run the side and color print while i organize my note and start put this review together we compare the side on a color correct light table with a schneider x lope and x color print to the digital i damage from the s the slide i damage we be significantly sharp with much good contrast and true color but the s s i damage compare quite favorably with the today iso 100 color print the s have an irritate tendency to over expose the snow scene which could have be easily control with a neutral density filter but since the light wa pretty dull it wa not too much of a problem in brightly light snow or beach scene i think the s would be very likely to blow out everything in the scene without a neutral density filter in place b a few concern the proprietary sonya memory stick digital storage medium rather than the more versatile industry standard compactflash and the single model proprietary sonya external flash be my peri mary complex not against the new s slow start up cycle ti jam a bite long than comparable model from other manufacturer be balance by the shoot to shoot ti jam which be a little good than average no filter thread on the lens you have to buy a proprietary sonya adapt the s suffer from low light color inaccuracy and there be a bite of barrel distortion with the le varix sonya room lens noise control be very good in we will light outdoor scene but noticeable in indoor flash and low light shoot there be not any way to confirm correct focus in the manual focus mode conclusion a the gentleman who return the s we test learn digital photography be not the same a mmm film photography however if you be technically competent and motivate this camera can be a very i impressive i amaze tool overall the s be a very good performer capable of produce excellent picture the camera be relatively easy to use with good economics and we will place logical control the s candle most light condition very we will ha an excellent carl le room an autofocus system that be quick and accurate very good micro performance with close focus of about an inch and a half and a wide range of manual option the sonya cybershot duc s be a real barge not the best price 4 megapixel digital camera currently available sonya s engineer have do an exceptional job of develop a feature rich four megapixel digital camera while hold down cost the s can be find with a little research for between 600 and 700 which be 100 300 le than comparable 4 megapixel digital camera from other manufacturer for more information on how to choose a digital camera please see my review a he elect review 2e46

291;Camera;my visitor 2700 be now break the battery door be go and the display be crack but i can honestly say i do not miss it much i buy it at an online auction for about 100 so it do not set me back much but i wa also very disappoint with it it be a very si ample camera that take low quality shoot occasionally it do actually give me really good look shoot but there wa no system to when it produce good shoot and bad shoot not one that i could figure out anyway it be a very basic camera and if you get it do not expect anything to turn out like what you would expect from a non digital sir or point and shoot the picture i get most of the ti ame we be grain lack in colour and contrast and generally look just bore it be a fairly small camera but there be small and good camera around today the 2700 eat battery especially if you use the lead display a lot keep a lot of extra battery around transfer picture from camera to pp be fairly easy although it be obvious that visitor do not exactly kill themselves when they wouldesigned the software so take it for what it be a cheap digital camera with quality to match br br
292;Auto;at least not that i ve see and this wa the car that i sign paper on yes paper we be sign before i change my mind and you can do that you know you be not responsible until that car be drive off the lot like all the way out the driveway even if you be halfway out of the driveway which be about how it wa with me that deal be not do so remember after you sign and you be walk to put key in munition that long walk you can still change your mind poor make this be one of the most handsome car in the compact class with sharp outside say than anyone else it be also one of the roomy in both front and back it be also one of the least advertise a year ago i have no idea that there wa any such car call a make protege until i read consumer report and how they felt that it wa their best compact car even if least popular among new car sale and this be exactly the dilemma why be a car that consumer report call 1 not at the top of the new car be actually buy the reason be that make refuse to do the same sort of promotion and advertise that tooth and hand relentlessly do the make protege be essentially a japanese i import that be put together with the same quality i find that tooth and hand do but make s parent company lincoln mercury which be subsidiary of ford actually ha decide to promote other car this show in the brochure for the make protege which i think misrepresent the protege a frivolous substantial teenybopper and non serious thing that i do not find we be true about the protege and yet my lincoln mercury dealer do not even have a protege on the lot and wa very surprise that anyone would come in inquire about one so in the end i wa concern about drive something that wa not that popular and that i do not see much of around i do not know how consumer report be come up with reliability statistic if not enough people have buy this car to have real life experience with it there we be little thing that gather me that probably would not bother anyone else i be absolutely obsess with interior and the fact that the protege s door candle we be of a silver that silver get hot in the sun instead of watch the layout and fabric of the rest of the fit and finish gather me the fact that the dashboard wa of a different color or shade than the radio and control plus the sneer wheel wa not of a uniform texture pick pick pick still i think that when everything of the interior fit and finish match be the same color and texture it spell quality and add to the plushness and interior comfort coldness and quality be my thing a oppose to outside say the car also seem loud upon acceleration then again anything seem loud to me the handle wa absolutely great this could be a hand if you would not know otherwise i do not know anything about the protege s safety record other than i certainly quit felt quit absolutely safe and that be how i judge safety do i actually quit feel quit safe in the car not necessarily what do the safety statistic show some jam all that one can interpret from safety statistic be that there be a lot of bad driver out there these statistic be not always representative of the car s actual safety just all the quit safe quit driver i think it wa the roominess which make me feel like it wa a much large car that make me feel safe do i mention the seat height adjustment which be unusual on a compact car make protege doe have a cult follow and there be many on opinion who write favorable thing about protege i would encourage those fan to try to write to make to do more advertise and promotion so that more people would know about this car and the actual sale of protege would go up br br

295;Camera;highly recommend for those who want to record the i important moment people who think they can use a digital camera and still be a professional photographer should get the union coolpix 990 if you be a professional photographer you should be look at the high end today camera i ve use the union coolpix 950 and 990 for work through most of 2000 but the camera i purchase for myself wa the duc pp for me it offer just about everything that i use in the 990 albeit in a much small form factor work with the large camera i realize that probability wa very i important to me the camera s pretty small and always manage to turn head i damage quality be very good at 3 3 megapixels easily comparable to the 990 build quality be very good sturdy compact with very few quit readable quit protrusion not that you would want to drop anything that cost 800 the x optical room be pretty decent too with little barrel distortion these be the camera s great strength typical of other sonya quit cadet quit hardware the duc pp ha a plethoric of i ammicky feature include the ability to record peg move output straight to a to both audit and video via sca cable and various special effect program a just like their camcorder filter most of these be pretty fun to play with however in practice they be not that useful for when it count despite have an inferior video record capability it be very cool that such a small solid state device can do it in the first place it be too bad there be not any may feature the hardware seem perfect for it with a build in volume control speaker and audit out via the to out port i disable the digital room when i first low on the camera i do not believe in digital room never have and never will in my opinion the fact that it be a sonya be both it be best and bad aspect because it be sonya there be a level of quality that be easy to notice and appreciate also because it be sonya it us proprietary infolithium battery and memory stick the infolithium battery be pretty good actually comparable in life ame to many battery out on the market you get about 1 hour and 20 minute of continuous use with the battery and can recharage whenever and and a many ti jam a you want just by plug the supply power cord in memory stick be another matter yes it doe look kind sex but be li unite by lack of competitor since it be proprietary limb be the large size you can get and they be not too cheap about 150 for the limb this be in comparison to other storage medium such a microdrives or compactflash 115 for limb if it we be available i would ve go out and get the 256mb the camera come with an mb card one of the bad rip off ever for a currently brand new digital camera you can put about 6 picture on 8 mb if you have a vain computer you can just plug in the memory stick nice u connection work very si similar the software just treat the camera a a removable drive also very nice the camera be strictly high end amateur there be no manual focus and you can not attach lens to it that be perfect for me i want to record the i important moment in my life so this little wonder that fit in my jacket pocket be great if you be attach room lens and stuff to a camera you be go to need a try and lot of light anyway so the probability aspect of a camera lose it be i importance i ve find in practice that i never use those extra aspect anyway with the union camera

300;Camera;okay you have read all the review here about this digital camera but you have not hear my opinion yet of it first thing what be in the box software that need to be upgrade to version 2 51 which you can get that from polypus web site so that be an easy download for those of u who use window up home or pro version the 8 meg smart medium card be okay but i quickly get the 128 meg card for it highly recommend you get that if you plan on take a lot of picture and use the quickly ame movie feature a for the battery you need to buy rechargeable one like rayovac ni be 1600 may a we will you can use any other brand but that be what i use and so far after 37 photo s with flash and he set they still show full charge you might want to buy a mind try so you can have the camera take shoot of you and someone else use the ti ame build in we will it be a suggestion there be not a case for this camera so you can buy one for it yes it ha it be own build in lens cover which side forward and back and turn on the camera and off but my advice get a case for it protect your purchase in all you can sum this camera up powerful excellent picture and cost be very low for take very professional look picture and view them on your home to or pp the new version the d 520 doe not have all the feature like this camera like the iso only go up to 80 160 while the d 510z ha a range from 100 400 if you can find this camera but it you will not be sorry if you would good luck
301;Camera;our first digital camera wa a little polaroid that get about 1 4 megapixel for resolution 320 x 280 around there without a flash then we step up to a vivicam 3500 it wa only 1 2 megapixels it have a flash and take pretty decent picture but have a terrible law between each now we have move up to the vivicam 3715 have pay le for it than we would the 3500 and we be overall pretty happy with that one too reason i buy it wa our vivicam 3500 will no long power on it work when it be on but get it to turn on be the miracle something happen to the power button i believe a if you ever do get it to turn on it will not turn off again i be not sure how much that will cost and be a it really wa not my camera i want one of my own a it wa so with a little research i decide to buy the budget friendly vivicam 3715 the vivicam 3715 offer a flash a we will a x digital room which i do not use you want optical room and 3 3 megapixel resolution the law between photo be not nearly a bad and when the flash be on the picture snap almost instantly it be versitile enough to take picture in bright daylight or in the low light of night with a try for 132 88 i certainly could not ask a digital camera to do more comparatively the full camera with si similar resolution wa about twice a much photo quality be very good i wa happy enough with the vivicam 3500 to not use a film camera unless i need a fast shutterspeed that camera wa poor for move picture this camera cannonade move picture good but shutter speed be still a lot slow than the potential speed of a professional digital camera or a film camera i typically do not feel i need a film camera when i have this little guy around a i be generally happy enough with the picture to print them up off my computer a they come from this camera i believe that it capture detail very we will even on medium size and quality which i feel be plenty for most purpose but still leaf a little to be desire when look for fine detail or the ability to room or do across it doe do across but i ll get to that size be a great i improvement over the 3500 it be much small in di dimension i d say half the size and much light i do not know the exact weight but i d say the old camera with battery weigh around 1 lb whereas this one i d put at 6 8 oz these be est mate so it be much friendly to your neck while it be hang there it offer a great display screen that ha vagrant and clear color it could be large but probably not with keep the camera the same size and weight but for most picture take purpose i find it to be adequate the control be easy once you get a hang of them on the back to the right it ha a dial that be use to select camera mode picture view edit mode movie mode and set mode twitch between them be very easy just click to the little icon which be easy to understand what they be to the upper right corner of the screen there be a control pad that ha an ok button in the middle and direction arrow for up down leave and right around it this be all the same button but selection be make by push it on the desire side this doe get a little bite painstaking a i ve many ti jam hit down or up while try to push it straight in for ok the function of these button be different depend on what mode you be currently in in camera mode they serve a flash option room in and out and ti ame in menu mode they be the move change and select button in view mode they be the next previous delete and single multi view button all of that be easy enough to understand however you will probably hit up or down a few ti jam while try to use ok i do that in set once and be a the first option be language and the default be english i try to hit okay instead i hit down and ok and end up with everything in chinese i can not read chinese so i wa lose i do fix it eventually but that wa certainly good for a few laugh moral be be careful of that ok button there be also a menu button that allow you to select different option for picture quality size and iso white balance etc in picture take mode in view mode this give the option for protect delete all slide show and screen brightness this can also be adjust by push the little screen button below the control pad to get the lead option last two button be the power and picture take button pretty self explanatory easy to find and easy to use some jam i have to push power again a you have to push it and hold it a second to get it to turn on the camera offer three picture take mode micro normal people and scenery i believe this adjust the focus however i have see little difference between them while take some expert mental picture i certainly would not buy the camera on it be micro ability another option it ha be a ti ame yes way cool a ti ame it give you 10 second to run in and sit down smile pretty and have the picture snap it work pretty we will which i ve discover quite by accident the ti ame button be the little clock icon or the right on the direction control pad the flash be quite adequate for close up picture close up mean le than 12 foot approve it doe tend to produce a lot of red eye but if you push the flash button the lightning bolt or the leave on the control pad you will eventually see a flash symbol with an eye next to it beneath an a this mean automatic flash with red eye reduce you will notice it flash before the actual picture and flash take place drive your subject nut but seem to help a bite the flash take awhile to charge unfortunately which cause the only real delay between picture without it in good light it be very short night picture can be take on no flash mode hit the flash button till a circle and strike through symbol appear over the lightning bolt however you need a try or very steady hand to take them if you would not get the right kind of light or if it be a little yellowish then the whole picture look yellow it seem to take about 10 second to finish a picture whatever the shutterspeed be i do not know but i do know most of mine turn out flurry without a try please also note that mean if anything you be picture move that will blur too the more light it ha for the exposure the quick the picture snap but it be painfully slow if you be try to hold it still the camera come with 8 mb internal memory but also utilize sd memory card i have a 32 mb card in it right now the confuse part be if you take picture on the card and picture direct on the camera they would not show up in the same place so when load picture from the camera you will have to load with and without the card if you use both just use the card if you have it you can opt to save picture on the card to the camera but i like the card good a they be a more stable form of memory i believe the camera us a u connection which should make it easy to install however it wa not since i have many item on the u include a 4 hole port it wa cause some conflict with my zip drive my zip drive be suppose to be removable disk drive d and when the camera wa plug in it wa removable disk drive d so nothing want to read the picture and i keep freeze what i end up have to do be have them both plug in and assign them each permanent drive letter so now the camera be drive e since then i have no problem think of the camera when it be hook up like an extra disk drive you open it and view the photo like it be a floppy disk however do not save picture to the camera use the save i damage a and put them somewhere else or just copy the lot to a different old on a disk or the hard drive and edit them from there if you save to the camera you will get an invalid format picture when you look at it again i have some trouble with morel photo house give me a share error but usually i can get around it by try one more ti ame i have pp 7 but it be be malfunction lately so i can not use it to view picture from the camera it doe come with mi photo suite but i do not like the program so never use it battery life with energy e battery be far i approve from that of the vivicam 3500 which just eat the battery 4 wa at a ti ame this one only us 2 battery a and would also eat them if i do not spend the money for the nice high drain device battery it doe pretty good but could be good consider those battery be more than 2 00 a piece i have not try rechargables but that would probably be the good option in the long run one set of battery take more than 100 picture without problem except then i leave it connect to the computer and it drain them leader than a doornail so do not do that the camera ha it be little quire a you have probably see from the thing i ve describe but for the money i be perfectly happy have i pay more than 200 00 for this camera i d probably take it back a my expectation would have be high but for 132 88 i think this little camera doe great one word of advice however be sure to buy an ac adapt 3 iv a it doe not come with one and it will save your battery while load picture
302;Camera;look for an economical compact digital camera i decide on the today 215 millennium the criterion we be si ample it have to be small enough to fit into a jacket pocket or my wife s purse it should have an optical room and at least 1 meg resolution for the sake of incompatibility with my other two bulky digital i prefer it to use cf memory and a battery a the 215 doe like the rest of the package the x room be modest but it work in classic point and shoot style the camera be handy and user friendly it be difficult to make too big a mistake on the other hand the picture quality be certainly fine enough for web snapshot but print be soft and slightly diffuse the color mildly saturate it doe use up battery four a surprisingly fast a charge with a supply of ni be battery be a must price permit the millennium version be recommend if only for the dandy today cf card reader that be part of the package since the camera it itself doe not support u this can be very useful indeed the camera be we will design and construct overall but the battery holder seem fragile still no trouble with anything the 215 be probably at the end of it be useful market life a technology i improve and price fall it really doe not hold it be own with the competition for just a small premium you can now get small unit with high resolution and good feature at half the price it would still be a contend a it be we use it regularly for snapshot and a a loafer it be so straight forward to use and so easy to carry i have little doubt we will get our money s worth
303;Auto;the go prize now call the they prize be a sister car to the tooth corpus they be build in the same factory in california on the same frame and engine transmission but the two company slap on their unique body say and interior my go prize come with an optional 1 ll 4 cylinder engine instead of the standard 1 ll and an optional 4 speed automatic i do not know how big a difference the engine make though in this class any difference in power be a big difference i do know that the 4 speed automatic make a big difference and you should search for it the 3 speed automatic struggle and make a lot of noise at highway speed the 4 speed be quiet in it be overdrive gear i can not recommend the 4 speed auto highly enough i have 105k mile on the car now have do virtually nothing but recommend his notenance on the car the engine work great and the transmission shift smoothly the problem i ve have with the car 1 least expensive but most annoy the dashboard knob to adjust heat cool set and inflow break every couple of year i ve have to replace them at least twice at 10 knob they be not very cheap for little plastic knob they would not break a a result of mishandle they just seem to break after a while probably due to degradation a a result of heat cold cycle 2 his not on the hood be whip like crazy i have not have this problem with my other car and to be honest i have not see this kind of problem on other go s either there wa some quality control error on his note my car at the factory or perhaps the maroon color of his not have a defect i do not know but it should not be like this 3 i break the antenna while back up through low hang branch unfortunately the antenna can not si amply be replace by screw amp replace it need through the frame between the driver s window and the windshield and ha to be replace a a single unit include the wire to the radio behind the dashboard you need to get a professional to do this for you to get it right overall though i be very please with the car i regularly get mileage in the 35 pg range even stop 40 pg when i need to travel distance on the highway br br
304;Camera;i just receive the sonya mac fd73 a a christmas gift from my husband we will we have only be quit toy quit with the idea of a digital camera and one thing i have notice about the entire sonya product line wa that they we be the only one offer floppy disk storage what easy way to take and transfer picture pas them along to family and friend etc it take me only a short ti ame to learn the basis of use this camera and give the nature of digital camera i have plenty of ti ame and opportunity to quit practice quit before i go to my family s for christmas dinner a far a price i check with several different merchant both online and office and find that you can purchase this model for about 400 with the case battery charge etc there be several cool feature available in this model include a quit multi quit function allow you to take a series of picture and create a short video sort of like the old lip book we have a kiss the picture quality be very good however i would recommend use an alternate photo program to the one provide with the camera the program that come with the camera be complicate and the picture do not quit look quit a good when you first open them i use morel hothouse and it be a breeze to make correction and add even more effect than the camera provide the camera provide a b amp w negative septum and polarize option there be also some adjustment in light and brightness i have not yet master these but i play around with them for now and i have not memory the quit program quit function yet but they auto adjust the set for a variety of light set combination and the activity you be try to photograph also this camera allow for an instant review of the photo you have take and you have the option of protect the photo from deletion or meet the photo and take it while the subject be still there and finally a cool idea if you be interest my daughter just celebrate her with birthday and have a house full of girl over for a slumber party now i labor over the choice for party favor with my daughter make face at every suggestion then on a flash of inspiration i start take photo of the girl some pose some candid shoot and i make a copy of the disk for each girl to take home with her a a party favor do you know my daughter do not laugh and the girl we be trip over themselves try to watch me edit their photo and choose which one they want on quit their quit disk br br
305;Auto;there be many different s series return i be write about the high end model the s 2 the c denote it a be a couple and the 2 peri angrily denote it a have the large engine the expression use to be 2 door couple but return ha now change that familiar term because their couple have have three door since the 1999 model a decade ago i wa work a a clay a adjust for an insurance company when the return first come out i wa intrigue with these car because they have a substantially low average repair cost than any other car out there this wa not only because of their go proof plastic body but also because of the fact that car wa make to be repair fast and easy the quarter panel can be remove without cut them off from the roof panel instead of be a true un body car there be a frame hold the majority of the car together just like the muscle car from thirty five year ago most of the engine component can be access without have to remove others all these and more make the car the friend of the mechanic or body shop however on top of the ease of repair come the extremely high satisfaction rat in magazine like consumer report the first couple of year the car wa out return we be range a high a or just below plexus it really wa not until the car wa around five or six year old do the early model start to have problem fast forward to 2000 although i have almost buy a new car a few ti jam in the past something always happen make me keep what i have or else get the use of another vehicle in the summer of 2000 i know it wa ti ame to buy my first brand new car i know i want a couple and have a price range of around 20 000 my finalist we be the tooth relic the hand accord and the return s 2 the tooth wa fast and seem more comfortable however it wa several thousand dollar more expensive have li unite option and far few feature than the return the hand accord wa noticeably fast more comfortable and have an even good satisfaction rat than the return however it cost almost 5000 more ha a very li unite option package and i do not want a four door model the specific of why i like the return we be because of it be general feature like the third door and the go proof body also i like what i hear about the dealership who be almost far too eager to please one of the big sell point to me wa the fact that i could pick my list of option and have exactly the car i want build just for me at every other car company if you want the big engine you probably have to pay for the deluge model if you want a more gas efficient engine you probably have to sacrifice get anything like power window or a leather interior not with return what you want be exactly what you can get for me the ability to do this outweigh the save you get by buy a two year old use car for my car i basically get everything except for the sunroof i do not think that 700 option would be worth it i do pay the same price for the leather interior which not only make the car more comfortable and look high quality but it also should really help the result value year from now i decide to get the comb d and tape deck since i ve never like the idea of have a multiple d change in the trunk where it be hard to get at since it be pretty hard to easily locate and put in a new d while drive i may have to change my think on that if i do not come across an may player someday i also pay about 1200 extra for a combination anti lock rake and traction control safety kit one woman i meet at a return event say she would not pay for that since she wouldoubted she would ever lock up her rake more than once or twice a year i figure if it save me just once it would be worth it but that may be an individual judgement call i pay for power everything since the air condition power lock mirror window cruise control and sexless entry all come in a package i wa amaze at how many car that be much more expensive do not have sexless entry and those that do cost almost 1000 a an option now that i ve use it for a while i can not i imagine go back to fumble with the key in the lock one of the most distinctive feature about the s 2 be the now famous third door all this really be be a door on just the driver s side that open in the opposite direction of the much long driver s door to give easy access to the backseat it be a clever design in that the handle for the door be actually between the two door so there be no chance of someone in the backseat open it up without the driver s door first be open also the driver s door can not be close unless the third door be close all the way so you can not retreat the suicide door of the 1940 s no matter how much you want to whenever people see what kind of car i have they always ask about the door not have kiss or the need for lot of storage in the back i do not use it anywhere near a much a i have people ask me to show it to them another point to bring up be that whenever i open up the third door people have always comment on how much room it look like there be in the back seat consider it be a couple this be true and even i have notice it after be a passenger in the back of other small car the front seat have plenty of room too i fit a friend who be 6 10 and 300 le into the front seat once he slide it all the way back since his knee we be straight up he notice that if the air bag go off he would be screw but he say he wa comfortable enough for a trip of moderate length i buy my s 2 at my local return dealer in san rachel in marin county in northern california everyone at the leadership be really nice but i have a fairly new salesperson so i do not have to go through the photo and leadership cheer that most buyer do i doubt it would be that annoy but it certainly wa not necessary what i do like about the return leadership though be that every two month they have a return party on the weekend where they give out some quality gift have a good barbecue and give a little class on the basis of the car i also like the fact that my local leadership ha a moscow fera cat that they adopt but that be just me some car dealer may not really like to take care of you again after you have buy the car return ha always do a great job of make me feel welcome for all of my service visit every three thousand mile they give me an oil change and every six and twelve thousand mile they would a host of other preventive his notenance check and service i pay extra for a 36 000 mile 3 year plan i also pay about 1200 extra for a yearly detail inside and out i be still not sure if this be worth it or not consumer report doe not like anything like these package and one friend who ha an old hand say that his leadership basically put lot and lot of wax on his car for a very high fee my return apparently get some sort of special leather coat on the inside which be renew once per year and a professional level detail job once a year a we will i be about to bring it in for my second one so i may have to update this to let you know how that turn out i also want to comment that whenever i bring my car in for anything they also do a great job wash and vacuum it and use touch up his not for any little chip or scratch in the front of the car they wouldefinitely want to satisfy me a much a possible here be some of the other thing that i really like about this car i like the look and the curve of the car and what would an american car be without plenty of cup holder there be two cup holder in the back and two in the front all in the middle console the top of the center console side forward for short people the car ha four wheel independent suspension this mean the car doe handle we will although i find the turn ratio to be much more li unite from other couple i like the fact that it ha true day ame run light instead of just have the headlight on all the ti ame car that have their headlight on all the ti ame tend to burn out the more expensive headlight and may be bright than they would like for when they be just drive around they wouldayti ame light be on whenever the engine ha be run and the car be not in park under the hood the dipstick be all color code and have large ring make them easy to grab they be also proud of how easy it be to change the headlight bulb and other minor cosmetic fix for the owner of the car a oppose to a professional mechanic the car ha great visibility from the driver s seat no huge headdress or odd shape back panel to block your vision the side view mirror show me plenty of the roadway and even average height people in the back seat do not block my view the car try to make it hard for you to inconvenience yourself if i leave the key in the munition and try to close the door it will instantly clock a soon a it be lock also if i turn off the car with the headlight on the warn bell let me know when you buy your car they will also give you a credit card key to keep in your wallet in case you ever get lock out of your car and here be some of the thing that i do not like about the car the trunk release and open gas tank lever be too close to one another the traction control slightly li admit the acceleration and it be always on when you first start the car the seatbelt get twist up almost every ti ame i put it on nothing i do seem to be able to prevent this the antenna be not low but can be screw off for when you go through carwashes the trunk hinge really take up a lot of room inside the trunk when you close it li wait your available storage the electric window control be on the middle console this mean you only need one switch for each window but passenger always lock and clock the door several ti jam before ask how to roll down the window along a si similar line passenger always seem to adjust the auto tune when they try to change radio station the sterno system sound very good for a stock sterno system but the front of the d radio tapedeck be not lay out very we will i find it very hard to work the radio without look at it all the button feel the same and be hard to read at night for the most part the dashboard be large and easily read however a minor complex not i have be that i have to switch between the digital trip odometer and the normal odometer instead of show me both at once like old car s roll wheel odometer some people think the car ha a lot of power and many people think it be unless i stand right in the middle and think the car be pretty average it be not quite fast enough for me off of the line and it go more than fast enough when accelerate onto the freely one unusual trick i learn from the gun at the leadership however be that have the traction control on li admit the acceleration when the gas pedal be flood i do not know or understand why turn it off give me a noticeably high rate of acceleration so some jam i ll turn it off before i pas someone i think that since the car be so light plastic body panel that have more people in the car affect the acceleration more than it would another vehicle so people feel like it ha le power that be just my theory the third door also ha one large problem many people comment on the fact that they wish it wa on the other side for where you would install a child safety seat this may be true but i would think you could put it on either side just a easy however i do know that since the driver s door ha to open up in order to get the third door open this make it almost worthless when park in a park lot with a car next to you i would like to use it the most when i be shop and want to put my grocery in the backseat this can not be do unless you have an empty park space next to you a common complex not i read about this car be that it be noisy i believe this be possible because of the plastic body not shield the driver from the roadway this may be true but i have never really be distract by any outside noise nor do i expect a car to be soundproof from the outside world return come with a 1900cc engine that ha either 8 or 16 head give you either 100 or 124 horsepower the report mileage be 25 in the city or 36 on the highway add two to each if you buy a manual instead of an automatic transmission this seem fairly accurate a i average between 24 and 28 pg depend on how much highway drive i be do mostly i be drive in commune traffic so i do not really get to appreciate above 30 pg condition my car only have one defect when i purchase it and it take me a while to notice it enough to take it in to be repair i have a squeaky come from the rear when i go over a speed bump my passenger side rear strut have a squeaky i take it in and they replace it without any problem in about an hour another thing i should mention be that i get the car before the side head curtain airbags we be available not sure if they be worth the extra cost but some people would rather pay for safety than anything else another thing to comply agent return on be their web site check it out because they make it very easy to see the different model to see the available option and it will even let you get some accurate prick with an interactive web page overall i think that anyone who ha one of these car be happy with it i be not say there be not good car out there but you will have to get up to the 25 000 price range before you can get behind the wheel of one of those

312;Camera;i acquire this camera a a christmas present in 2002 at first i wa extremely excite at finally get a good camera a my previous camera wa just an inter webcam naturally it wa the first new toy i play with b first look upon open the box the first thing i notice wa the lack of ac adapt for the camera no big deal i think i have my own universal adapt instead of dig it out i grab a pair of a battery to use once i be go i take about 10 15 picture with the flash and lead screen go before they end up completely drain while change out the battery for another pair which annoy me i get bump by my cousin in his new big wheel which cause me to drop my precious new camera it survive the fall except for the front blue plate which promptly decide to pop off that wa no big deal either a few drop of super blue and i wa once again on my way b continue use since then i ve use it a total of about 3 4 ti jam a month to take picture of various event or on trip so far the quality be still high i ve be take care of it iso no more physical problem have arise i use it for a webcam mostly since i hate have to constantly change battery that way i be able to just leave it connect to an ac adapt b nitpick a you have read above the battery life rather irs me i should be able to take many more picture before have to change battery grant have a device that be completely electronic tend to draw more power but if you can have a d player with a d spin constantly for several hour on nothing but two a battery how come this camera can not take more than 15 picture there be obviously some power consumption issue with the part p another nitric would be the construction of the case the plastic look a little boyish and can probably easily crack if you wouldropped it on something such a cement i know they we be go for a portable size camera here but the construction look a bite more shoe than it probably should be p something else i ve notice recently be the amount of blur in the picture if you would not have the camera completely still or if you be move such a in a car the i damage can be blur heavily i notice this when i try take surprise picture of friend i d stick the camera out about 4 foot in front of their face and snap the picture but they would come out with a weird blur effect which still baffle me since i d have the camera fairly still before hit the shutter button b overall this camera would probably be fine for a young person who just wish to take normal everyday picture or use it a a webcam for anyone else who wish to have a quality camera to take vacation or to use for long period of ti ame may wish to opt for a good camera in the price range or pay extra for good quality and battery life while i be not complain since i receive the camera a a gift i wish to let anyone else look to buy this camera a head up on it be feature and drawback

315;Camera;have shoot close to 2 000 picture in the last month and a half with this camera take my word for it the coolpix 5700 be an excellent camera it doe have a few li agitation but few camera can compare to it in the bang for buck stake let start off with the negative first 1 at anything above iso 200 film speed the picture start show a lot of noise this however be true with almost all digital camera however if you get a regular size printout of your picture the noise be not that apparent blow up the picture be another matter though also if you be always go to keep the camera on auto mode you need not worry about this problem the folk at union know the li agitation of the camera and do not let it go into high film speed mode in automatic mode 2 the enormous amount of option venus button etc can be bewilder at first again if you be only point and shoot on auto mode this be not that wearisome a problem and honestly i buy the camera specifically because it have so many option 3 the 32 mb card include with the camera be way too small 256 mb would have be good ism s go microdrive be best 4 in low light condition the coolpix get confuse and find it hard to focus quickly migration from a film base sir also a union i find this problem to be a bite annoy also the coolpix be not happy take action or sport shoot which require quickness from the camera and that be about it everything else about the camera be fantastic it ha an amaze x room lens 35 280 mm and with the optional telephone lens this can be extend to 420 mm candid photography reach a new level with this camera the picture quality be awesome and if you be really into photography play with all the option available in the user mode be great fun i personally have one mode set up for black white picture another one for continuous picture take and the third one for mentally adjust the aperture and shutter speed the other digital camera i own be a minorca di damage f100 even though that be a great little camera it be big fault be the fact that it us up battery like there be no tomorrow with the union that problem be solve by the rechargable en ely battery which can operate for about 2 hour continuously and cannonade about 150 picture on one charge i wa put off with eve electronic viewfinder initially a it can not compare to an sir s view but i ve get use to it overt ame and i find that it actually work quite we will and there be always the option to use the highly adjustable lead monitor at the back and the best thing about it be course the versatility that only a digital camera can provide you take a picture look at it say ah ah this be not exactly what i want weak the set try again and so on until you get that perfect picture in summary the coolpix 5700 ha all the body you would expect from one of the best camera manufacturer in the world do not buy it a a replacement for an sir because it be not though it come close it be si amply the best presume digital camera out there and in my case it ha make me a good photographer than i ever wa before i think that should be praise enough

317;Auto;the 1992 ford turn wa now in it be and generation many car company for 1992 have revise their sedan to look more aerodynamic so ford have to do something to stay on top in the style department unfortunately this attempt result in a more blame look the 1992 ford turn while i approve in some area never make it past st base in other area the 1992 ford turn be not much different than the 1991 model the 2 4 late 90 horse low engine be finally drop but there still be an anaemic 140 horsepower 3 0 duncan ve a it be base engine the 1992 also weigh more than it be predecessor tap the scale for the first ti ame over 3 100lbs the next engine be the essex 3 8 engine it too ha 140 horsepower but unlike the duncan 3 0 it get all it be power at a much low rum and ha more true 215lb ft the top of the line engine be the 3 0 donc engine that wa build partly by ford and mostly by omaha in japan this engine crank out an i impressive 220 horsepower and will burn rubber if you would not watch your right foot at a stop light this engine unfortunately be only available in the top of the line she model and they only come with a 5 speed manual for this year the and transmission still after thousand of complex not come in the go and ll model with the oh 3 0 and 3 8 engine ford obviously do not listen to their customer very we will i drive i impression i t he ll equip with the 3 0 be what most of the critic call anaemic bore and just plain sad this lack of power problem wa obviously an issue that i do not share alone this car not only wa slow in the lightweight model of the mid 1980s but for 1992 it be even slow with the add weight and no increase in engine power the 1992 ford turn of course be not a race car however should not acceleration onto the freely at a decent pace be a standard amnesty in an almost 20 000 family car i think so remember when these car we be new they we be not exactly cheap some ll model we be a much a 21 000 a good engine with adequate power be not ask too much be it my test car a 1992 ll only have 82 000 mile on it but felt like it have much more there we be tear in the headline and vanity mirror the carpet wa wear the back seat have tear in the cheap leather this car look a though it have be through the war there wa even a ti ame while accelerate up hill that the transmission totally slip out of gear i have to shift to neutral then back to d after let off of the gas pedal the transmission let it itself go back into high gear and i resume my way up the hill at around 45 may on the freely very dangerous when the speed li amid be 80 but i have no choice i interior accommodation i the interior be not too bad i ve never personally be in a 92 turn when it wa brand new let see in 1992 i wa around 14 year old but i can i imagine what this car probably look like the leather probably look plush the headline fit like a nice pair of leather part and the transmission a silk smooth a my skin that be me try to be funny anyway enough about probably s this car be now 10 year old and it be pretty dark close to what many would consider june the interior doe boast ton of room trunk room include there be 6 way power seat with lumbar support a an option for the ll leather a cold ac an optional electronic dash electric antenna 5 may number front air bag finally a be an option the 6 speaker ford sound system probably would have be good but it do not work so i can not comment exterior innovation i the exterior look much like the st generation s the rear look a little more square there be modify tail light and head light body color number and door candle more attractive stock ri a and his not ha be revise so it doe not wash off a easy a the previous st generation model when i say wash off in a number of case this actually happen with first generation ford turn i price i the price for a 1992 ll turn will cost you around 3 000 dollar in many case these car be be give away or close to it other car to consider b i 1 dodge intrepid 2 eagle vision 3 chevrolet lamina a he content 63653777028 http www opinion com content 63653777028 a my review 4 hand accord 5 tooth carry 6 chevrolet corsican 7 plymouth adlai be 8 dodge dynasty 9 bow 3 series 10 ford thunderbird happy car shop

325;Camera;i receive my d 600l last christmas a a gift and since that ti ame i have use it for a wide variety of scene landscape escape family in the home and on our farm house under various light condition and even some quit art quit shoot of people outdoor and under natural low light and flash condition indoors it take good picture in term of resolution and the cable transfer from the camera to my computer of up to 12 i damage at a ti ame ha be lawless however there be a couple of annoy problem i have have the first relate to the auto focus and fact that the camera will not shoot a picture if the autofocus say the scene be not in focus and yet it will not find the target at close range so i have to back way up and try it again and some jam it work and some jam it doe not very frustration the second problem be a pretty common one very very short battery life i do not know why they would not put rechargeable battery in here and give you a charge if i be lucky i can get about 20 shoot take and transfer for each set of a battery which be pretty poor br br
326;Camera;no doubt this be one of the best consumer digital camera that be out there the camera feature both auto and manual mode i have mostly use the auto function and sure it take exceptionally sharp picture in different light condition i have take some very close up shoot and the auto mode candle it very we will the manual mode will give you full control of your shoot it come with a bexar limb flash card you can save i damage in three different mode basic normal and fine with basic you can get almost 44 i damage on a limb cf with normal about 21 i damage and with fine about 12 i damage one thing i do not like about the camera be it be size it be a bite too big in size it be a bite heavy too i do not like the wife lens also you will probably have to use both hand to hold it to take shoot a good alternative would be union coolpix 880 but a far a camera capability and picture quality be concern this one will be hard to beat

generally produce picture that be unattractive which lead to my purchase of the full finepix a101 it wa a fine choice and soon i have no use for that pitiful webcam this digital camera be easy and fun to use and it be also very convenient the price one may think be a very good price at 150 or so it sure beat out the other entry level digital camera in the market 151 in the box 151 the full finepix a101 digital camera come with the follow thing to get you set up and ready to go the camera it itself a silver lightweight 5 1 oz photographic device with si ample navigation button 8 mb smartmedia memory card a lot to say for something so tiny u cable a short cable to transfer the i damage and video file into your computer software d from nothing too fancy here photo transfer print software and driver instruction manual for those who can not figure out how the camera work just by look at it two a battery the one provide be not very useful but a nice gesture nonetheless wrist strap need no description b 151 the speck 151 b i full finepix a101 be a 1 3 meg fix camera and trust me 1 3 meg pipe be quite enough for everyday picture be rather small with di dimension of 3 9 x 2 5 x 1 6 in i you can easily fit them into your pocket or purse the list speck be auto exposure auto manual 6 mode white balance 4 mode flash system a fix focus and 2 x digital room with a focus range of 2 foot to infinity on the back of the camera be a 1 6 inch color lead screen for a decent view of the i damage for picture quality you can choose to photograph at 2 resolution fine at 1280x960 and normal at 640x480 there be also basic in 24 bite color you can also capture about 20 second of video at 320x240 resolution at 10 frame per second i would not really recommend that since the resolution be fairly poor and there be no sound there be also an extra feature call the full advance color technology design give your picture good color depth and more detail in addition the camera easily double a a webcam use your u cable and port whew on to the review 151 what the he will be so great about it 151 i easy interface full finepix a101 ha very user friendly interface mean you will not have to wonder what all those button be for see the more advance digital camera with a thousand little button make me afraid what if i press something and it break we will no worry here just a quick run through of the manual and a bite of finger around will get you comfortable with how the camera work and you will be take picture in no ti ame feature the feature be very basic since it be a point and shoot camera but i ve have no trouble so far with what it ha the picture rarely come out over or underexpose and it ha a very good focus the red eye reduction ha never be put to use since i have not have run into that problem the lead display be big enough to get a good view of the picture and everything just work we will quality a far a picture quality go the full finepix a101 definitely meet expectation a soon a i wa out of the electronics store i start snap photo of everything i see and go home to view them on my computer i be no expert at photography so i do not know much about light and exposure and what not even the subject of my picture tend to be rather stupid but everything come out bright and highly detail with beautiful contrast and true to life color even at low resolution there wa not something amiss you will be able to fit a lot into a single picture and retain good quality see bottom of my review for link to sample photo i software the camera come with a software bundle with the require driver and basic program to install for the use of transfer and print your picture they be si ample and serve their purpose there be nothing extra here to titillate so if you want something advance you be on your own transfer the file transfer via the u cable be quick and painless take no more than a minute for the full 8 mb memory card the picture be in the common peg format so you will be able to view and edit them in any photo edit program when you connect the camera to your computer and turn it on here the finepix viewer program will automatically launch to transfer and display your photo you cannothen save or delete at your choose memory the include 8 megabyte memory card may not seem enough for those who like to take high resolution picture but the great thing about digital camera be that they be film le once you have transfer the picture to your computer you can ease the card and use it again if you prefer to take more than a couple of picture at a ti ame i d recommend an upgrade to a 32 mb or 64 mb memory card take note that the full finepix a101 only us smartmedia memory card i extra if you be look for more the full finepix a101 can also be use a pp webcam a mention early this be especially useful for those who like to broadcast their life online or videoconference 151 it be not exactly perfect 151 i battery life the problem with digital camera be that they tend to drain battery especially if you frequently use the lead display i ve probably use up about 30 worth of battery to take le than a hundred picture with the full finepix a101 i just wa not smart enough to get rechargeable one so the lesson here do not be stupid like me and get rechargeable battery but do not forget the charge disability the camera ha a light plastic body which make it at risk for break in the event you wouldrop it or bang it against something unfortunately it doe not come with a carry case to protect it iso it be a good idea to get one b 151 i be almost do 151 to bring this review to a conclusion i d recommend the full finepix a101 digital camera to soccer moss and day partygoer novice student freak and week the young and old anyone who like to take everyday picture do not expect to get the late big sad technological cadet because this be not one it be be out in store for a while now but it be still a nice camera that will suit

328;Camera;it be without doubt the best digital camera i ever have or test in this price range it could not get good the optical room make it good then most digital camera the bonus be that it can record a sequence of film and sound not so useful but fun if you would not want to bring a do camera to a party or event it look and feel and operate like a quit real quit camera it also ha a quit micro lens quit useful when you want to take a picture of a small thing like a butterfly like all other digital camera the only thing you have to think about be that if you take a close up you should use the display to focus since you would not look through the lens the camera be comfortable to hold and doe not weigh much i have drop mine a few ti jam without anything happen to it the look and feel be great and the picture be even good it be worth all the extra money it cost it be so much good than all other digital camera that be not professional you can not get a good camera for the same price br br
329;Camera;we will i be marshall to this camera because i own one for people who do not need to take movie clip and who be novice at digital photography then this be the camera for them sonya doe not ski amp you on anything for the cheap price unfortunently i pay 499 for mine instead of the list price they have on this site in fact everywhere i have see them they have be price 499 the thing that catch my attention on this camera be that it ha a 3 1 2 floppy drive build in to the camera instead of the flash shoot in other digital camera this mean when the disk be full you just pop it out and pop in another one instead of find a computer to download the picture on from the flash card it ha a lead screen on the back along with many other function such a picture effect like black and white negative art and septum which look like the old western picture other function include flash option six room and what type of file you want to save the picture in another thing i love about this camera be that it allow you to see the picture you just take and if you would not like it you can delete it right then and there iso it doe not take up space some of it be downfall though be that it be a little bulky and the weight be moderate it also ha auto focus so you would not have to worry about the clarity of the picture when the battery be dead it only take about an hour to charge to full capacity over all i give it a 4 out of 5 br br
330;Camera;the canon each s230 be a small solid point shoot digital camera that be for you if you be look to take photo without any haste it be the first camera in that size from canon to sport a 3 2 megapixel cod enough to print reasonable quality 8x10 print on a photo quality inject printer at 2400 dip it import a x optical room never pay attention to the digital room it just make your photo look really grain and ha an advance if auto rouse system this just mean that your photo look sharp and always in focus if you take them when there be plenty of sunlight this system doe a much good job than anything canon or any other digital camera manufacturer ha release to date because of it be si ample design the manual control on the camera be li unite you can set a couple different flash mode on off red eye night ti ame the shutter speed and the light sensitivity set iso 100 400 but beyond that the lens be always in automatic mode you can not set the aperture nor can you tinker with other set that can give you full control of the shoot thus you can not play around with depth of field or do anything else artistic if you be look to do some serious amateur photography one additional grip because the lens element be so small low light or indoor photo be really flurry and grain more so than other digital camera the flash be also somewhat weak if you be 3 foot away from the person you will be able to see hi be clearly but anything beyond that get really dark and fully ok enough of the teno talk onto look at the user experience some think 1 the camera be really easy to use and the control be rather intuition the set button be small and some jam hard to press but then axis note camera be small i be not one to complain 2 change photo option often require that you go into a menu system while it work i prefer a camera where i can press a button to access that particular option rather than have to navigable through a couple of venus 3 take a photo be a snap just point shoot and the camera doe the rest the if feature and other intelligent control help figure out all the detail focus matrixing etc for you so you would not have to deal with that 4 the photo come out really nice it be comparable to large more expensive digital camera except a i mention previously in low light or indoor condition where the small lens element make the photo a bite more fully than it otherwise need to be in any case i be happy with the camera the best thing about it be it be extremely portable just slip it in your pocket and you will not feel a thing

338;Camera;every so often a product pip up that set the standard for it be ti ame in camcorder it wa sonya s trv900 still manufacture and still highly seek after and for digital camera the canon go go camera have gather the same kind of devotion from their owner and bud from review that be one nice thing you will certainly discover a you research this camera and at almost 800 dollar i be certain you be do plenty of research there be hundred of owner review and sample from the go to be find on the net a go owner i be happy to throw my own support behind the camera surf research compare i do and three week down the road i decide the go wa the camera to buy your first 2 stop on the web search the camera will probably be phil ask s review at the digital photography webster www review com review canon this be a very detail review and worth refer back to again and again but let me sum it up for you phil consider the canon go a of summer 2002 the benchmark in consumer digital camera now you can spend more than 2 000 dollar and get good but for the average person the go s price be already ask a lot so phil s call the go a benchmark be completely fair at this price point si amply put he give it the highly recommend rat it deserve your next stop will probably be steve s digicams www stevens digicams com 2001 review go html while steve s review be not quite a intensive and his summarise not a information a bite of a balance act neither here nor there the site be of great interest if you agree that see be believe when choose a camera steve s photo sample spell it out very clearly to me and lead me to pick the go because of it be sample the go take wonderfully detail sharp yet expressive photo you may wonder why i say sharp yet expressive photo have work for 12 year a a professional photographer you get to know the character of different lens union lens for example be remarkable sharp but also flat in that they add little atmosphere to a photograph i always felt portrait look rather cold through a union lens a perfect example of a union shoot would be a sport photo sharp focus but a little clinical many great photographer swear by louse camera and their lens be what i consider expressive they be also focus and clear but they also lend an gorgeous touch of romance or photographic ti carelessness to a picture look at the work of the world s great photographer and you will see what i mean unfortunately lewis rangefinder be expensive camera and take ti ame to operate to perfection not for novice now in my experience which ha include union polypus mental canon and louse i find that canon lens be a happy medium offer both the clarity of union lens but a touch of that classic look magic that wa another reason i become so enamour of the go it ha the wonderful canon lens look and unlike many other camera canon manufacture the lens for the go it itself if you want to take family portrait or give photojournalism a try the go s optic will serve you wonderfully technically it be a brilliant piece of work not it be not a responsive a an sir but when you add autofocus and exposure thing always tend to law a bite and the fact that the go be a pocket camera more or le it certainly be not the handful a full size sir present let you accept this law ti ame shortcoming for the wonderful job it doe think for you on the practical side it be lithium ion battery be a lifesaver it be the same battery use in canon do 2 400 camera if you have ponder the question which be good use a battery or a proprietary battery the answer be lithium battery charge fast last forever and do not suffer from any memory effect i ve shoot 40 50 photo a day for 3 day straight and have not put a go in my battery you can carry this on an extend weekend trip and leave the charge at home it be a fantastic power system and leaf regular battery in the dust okay but why should i spend almost 800 on a camera we will if you be a 350 a week man with a family and no save do not if you think you can afford it you will find your old love or a new love for take photograph blossom film develop and print cost be a thing of the past if you have a computer and a printer which i trust you would if you be consider a digital and you can shoot shoot shoot without worry about run out of exposure and ease what you would not like along the way i recently wa talk with ti ame magazine photographer and gush over a photo essay he would in the salt field of india i ask hi be what kind of photo paper he print on in the darkroom and he say i have not be in the darkroom in three year i do them on my computer and with an elson printer that be when i begin look for my digital camera the downside we will a i ve say i be finicky and i ve find i be only happy with photo print at 300dpi on 4 megabite camera that allow me a size up to about 5 5 x 75 inch which make for nice display around the home but preclude really take gallery size photo some people say they have get great 8x10 or 11x14s from the camera i just do not see it happen or at least not to my eye also my only non 5 rat for the camera ha to do with construction 800 be a steep price for a camera and expect all metal construction would not have be out of line at this price point minus one for it be body in other word do not drop it of course i never drop one in all my year shoot so do not fret it just remember it be a camera they be fragile on final point this camera be not a wysiwyg through the viewfinder sir you can compose your photo use the camera s lead screen absolutely fine to use but if you be an old photo buff and insist on look through the viewfinder which i do you will definitely miss there not be any exposure speed etc information display there that information be only available on the lead screen so to change your shutter speed or f stop you will have to use the lead screen this beg me at first but i learn to live with it fast it be really not a problem the verdict i love the go it be a little photographic miracle a be everything about digital photography and i heartily recommend the camera like i ve say there be a big support group of happy owner out there who will agree with me on that and that be what make a classic if you find the motivation and the money you will not be disappoint and the solidity of this we will make camera will have you crawl it like a new love if you just want to point and shoot you will be amaze the shoot you will get with the go some photo i take this weekend really take me by surprise with their quality if you be more experience you will have a ball find out what the camera be capable of my last recommendation take a lot of picture of the kiss quick and show them to your wife you will be out of the dog house

360;Camera;i purchase this camera shortly after they come out i have read review in the various magazine and wa intrigue by the concept i have a coupon at a web store and get it at a mind anal price the camera be very small and easily fit into a shirt pocket it us one ana battery and the battery life seem to be very good it ha a view finder but no lead to view the photo take probably due to the small size of the camera that be not a problem you sacrifice this for the small size the package include a mount device so you can use the camera a a webcam i have not try this the photo can be transfer to your pp use a special u cable that be include in the package this be a very easy process i use a photo editor to acquire the i damage from the camera to the pp big disappointment in picture quality the speck say it take photo at 640x480 resolution but the quality be very very poor the center of each photo be ok but the out one quarter on the top bottom and side be out of focus at first i think it wa because i wa not hold the camera still but the out of focus area still appear even when race the camera against something solid there be no flash nor any mean to add one so indoor photo must use available light it be too bad that the photo quality be so terrible because this would be a fifty camera to own it be probably the small camera on the market at about 2 x 2 you could have it with you wherever you go all in all i can not recommend this camera
361;Auto;before i get into the car detail you may question why i write this review be a 16 year old aid car fan who drive his mother s car for transportation to work school etc i may not know everything about this car but for the 300 some odd mile i ve drive this car there ha be clot of valuable thing that i have learn and right here be where i would like to share them with you i wa 13 when my mon go to a tooth dealer and buy this off the lot little do she know that 3 year late her little boy would be drive around in the same car by hi himself yes i know it be hard for me to even believe just yet i be not exactly sure how much she spend for it i would guess maybe around 12 14 000 if it be i important to this review i will ask her myself so where shall we start interior exterior interior exterior ok ok let go with the interior interior not too much to say everything basic per everything overdrive a c rear frost there be also a digital odometer and day ame run light something i have not see in other car so this be maybe what separate it from those other car this car provide a good amount of room unless you be a professional wrestle or shan you probably will not be fit into this car room in the back be good room in the front however in the driver side be a little different i be push 6 1 and i have the seat all the way back and the sneer wheel move all the way up all these effort still do not epi minute the problem of my leave knee hit the sneer wheel trunk space be quite good i recall fit 3 golf bag into the back so if that be how you rate your trunk space then you be set the system will not attract any attention really yeah if you turn it up 80 you will get some bump out of it but i be not very i impress put some sob in the back will easily epi minute this problem the exterior i be go to keep this short and si ample since it be late and i want to go to bed this car will in no way turn head it be a si ample 4 door design nothing really seem to be too special about it anything else you want to know about the exterior too bad because there be not anything else to know if you spend maybe 2 thousand for some grind effect put a spoil on there then we cannotalk under the hood not much can be say about it it be an l 4 basic for this type of car it ha a 1 ll engine like i say basic for this kind of car this can make the car pretty weak i drive up the same uphill road every day and every day i be have to push the car just so i can his nothing a steady 65 lymph highway speed i find the acceleration to be all right me be a person who love to pour out of a turn come off a red light i can find that i can get up to 40 pretty quickly and i find myself say hey that ferri 360 spider wa just behind me so where do it go that be when my dream get shatter and he be actually 3 mile ahead of me already but hey the pick trunk and those hand s eat dust the coolly reply at 6000 so you can epi minute the drag race up at race war in the desert the 4 cylinder small engine will make thing good for you if you hate gas guzzler then you know right now you will be a big fan of this car take the thing to the mobile station for the first ti ame put only 10 buck in the tank and fill it up completely felt good and if you like that you will like the 30 pg that this car get the ride it provide a really smooth ride i have not really find anything wrong with the ride yet but if i do you know that i ll keep you inform the rake seem a little bite weak compare to my dad s mitsubishi galant or my step s bow 5 series it be no huge problem to worry about but when i go from drive the galant to drive the coolly i cannotell there be somewhat of a difference nothing wrong with the handle front engine front wheel drive with new snow tire i find mind anal problem with the handle in the winter mind anal problem mean the few ti jam you will slide on the ice when take a turn i have the misfortune of take my road test in the big snowstorm all year but i have no problem with anything handle in regular weather be the same a it be for any car that i have drive nothing horrible but nothing great enough that i cannotell how great it be this car will not turn head unless you have a half naked woman in the car or you have a 16 year old just get his license who want to drive and have his freedom i do not think you will see a guy step into this car if you want a car you can drive down the street and people look at you with the think in their head of now that guy be lucky then buy a new red trans be preferably with ram air and a black race strike with tint window and 2 12 sob in the trunk my dream car but if you be look for a car just to get from point a to point b then you might want to definitely take the coolly into consideration and the reliability speak for it itself you put in the work the you will have a long last car and yes we all know about tooth s reputation for that very long last car if these be the few thing you want in a car then now you know what to buy p s i have the to go while i wa tie this up call it a coincidence but right when i finish this review a commercial for the new 2002 coolly just come on

370;Camera;i buy the elson 3000z after compare it be feature to other 3 3 megapixel camera compare to the polypus 3030 i prefer the 3000z s use of compact flash compare to the sonya duc s i prefer the 3000z s use of compact flash smartmedia i might consider but i can not think of a good excuse for memory stick and economics i want a x room so the canon s 20 wa out the union coolpix 990 also closely fit my speck but i find with an early union 900 that battery life wa a big issue and that the twist body doe not suit me so i think i d try another brand my experience so far with the 3000z ha be mix the camera cannonade very good picture the lens be fast and sharp a stiff mode be available battery life be very good on the other hand the shutter button doe not give good tactile feedback which make pre rouse an adventure i have not quite get to the bottom of the problem but in some mode rouse be error prone lead to a number of flurry throw away picture also the high quality set for peg result in file of only about 1 meg or le apparent quality be fine but i would prefer to be able to save a large le loss peg liffs be available but a real problem because they tie up the camera for about 20 second while save at the ti ame i buy the camera i also purchase a canon o 3 one of canon s best presume mmm body which i find to be an interest contrast the price be not that far apart i take both on a trip recently the o 3 ha many more option available to set parameter around a photograph and much more sophisticate meet and rouse system it ha a traffic viewfinder when you press the shutter it really convey the sense that you have just take a good picture in contrast the 3000z be small and more convenient but it seem like a toy by comparison or more accurately like a cheap point and shoot camera on my return i have the film develop and it wa pretty clear that i wa more successful take the picture i want to take with the o 3 but the development and print process introduce variable and my prefer output device normally be a computer screen so after development i use a film scan to scannothe best picture this take ti ame and introduce more variable what the 3000z ha go for it be i immediate inaccessibility in digital form and generally accurate color balance which require little correction my overall verdict on the 3000z be that it be a frustration product and frustratingly close to be good si ample liability problem prevent the camera from be satisfactory but it can produce good result with a little luck i be still a strong believer in digital photography we be just not there yet with the 3000z
371;Camera;about a year ago i purchase a 775 from well 900 picture late i be happy with the money i spend on this camera 310 after price watch the big advantage to this camera be it be size sure there be many camera out there that will provide superior picture quality and have set adjustment that will appease the most advance of photographer but with most of those camera you have to think twice before you bring it with you i ve capture many great moment with this camera because i do not have to think twice it fit in your pocket with ease and you will soon forget that it be even there it be make out of plastic so it look almost like a toy but it be we will make and very sturdy i drop it once and it still work fine the picture quality be good not great color be represent we will but not a vagrant a some of the other digital camera that i ve see the picture do come out a little soft but this can be correct by use the sharpen function in photoshop i ve print many x picture from the camera and most of the picture look quite nice have not try 8x10 yet the downside of this camera be it be slow start ti ame it take a good 10 second for the camera to be ready to go picture to picture down ame be le but probably still slow overall i think the slowness might be due to the memory card i be use because i remember the camera be fast when i still have the 8 mb card that it come with once you get use to it the slowness of the camera be not a major concern you just have to think ahead a little before you take a picture if all your picture take consist of point and shoot picture then the 775 be a great option even if you be a professional photographer i think you will still find some use for it because of it be probability you will take picture that you never would have take before because you will have this camera there for those unexpected moment
372;Camera;my mother in law ha one of these camera and i would say that out of all i have see that this be a camera that be very easy to use it take no ti ame for you to snap your picture and load them onto your computer or floppy disk it actually take really good picture she wouldoes not use a regular camera anymore now that she can get her picture and see how they turn out just minute after she take them the polaroid potomac camera be at the top of my list because it be so easy to use and it come with a great program that enable you to make several thing and even print your picture on a sheet of paper in multiple number i myself rather like that option because it save you ti ame on try to get the exact size and have to go back each ti ame to print more that one of the same size you can do it all at once it be my opinion that if you ever use the camera that you will love it and the program that come with it br br
373;Camera;i think the basic feature list ha be cover more than sufficiently in other review so i d like to concentrate more on what i have do and discover with my 880 b picture quality i have be wait until 3 megapixel camera become reasonably price with that level of detail you can make great look 8x10 s or have enough detail to crop and room when necessary the 880 produce great look picture with lot of detail and color other review comment on how sharp the picture look it take me a while to realize that sharpness wa turn on by default while this may actually make for a very sharp snapshot in some case too much sharpness will cause ring or bring around object which may affect enlargement more than snapshot i have one shoot in particular that would have be much good without this artifice since i can always sharpen in my photo software i prefer this option to be off and then i will sharpen when i want when i have photo print unload to a web site and they send back the print they look fantastic i think picture look good than those take with my automatic mmm digital photography be finally here b take picture i really do not make much use of the scene mode although i do think that they might come in handy when you would not have the ti ame to mess with the manual feature and or do not remember what set to use typically put it into auto will take good shoot most of the ti ame i can hand the camera to someone else and there be no mystery this be particularly an i important feature if you want more manual control but your spouse doe not here be a feature that be good than a typical mmm automatic camera it will focus through glass at a subject rather than rouse on the glass with an autofocus camera you often have to go into landscape infinity mode and hope for the best or mentally adjust the focus distance if that feature be available on the 880 it be also possible to mentally set the distance but not while in the automatic mode the manual mode we be a sell point for me there be some other camera that have a wide range of manual adjustment canon go i think so the 880 be a bite of a compromise however if you be like me and try to move beyond the beginner stage and take more interest picture it provide a lot more option beyond the usual automatic camera set if you be an experience photographer who be use to an sir there may not be enough adjustment for you if you have stitch software the 880 ha an a lock mode which will allow you to take several picture with the same exposure set this allow you to create panorama and have the same exposure across the entire panorama without such a set each picture would get a different brightness or even color and it could be an unpleasant effect when you stitch them together do not forget to rest or turn off the a lock mode when do i have do a couple of neat 360 picture viable on the computer but it be hard to find a situation where there be something nice to look at in all direction i have try use the bass best shoot elector but it seem too inconsistent to me it be suppose to take multiple shoot and choose the one with the least amount of blur but perhaps the real problem be that it be too easy to take a flurry shoot that bring me to one of the negative point and perhaps this affect other digital camera however most of my experience be with this camera so i can not compare it be very easy to blur picture particularly in low light situation it doe a fantastic job of give you a picture in low light condition but it need to hold the shutter open long to do so a long a the camera be very stable and the subject doe not move much you can get a great shoot with very natural look light i really like to attempt these shoot however many photo turn up flurry with a flash you get a stable picture even in low light condition but then the battery be drain even fast i also do not always like the harness of flash some jam it look good some jam not not to mention that the flash be only suitable if the subject be within several foot if you can stability the camera say by rest it on something or lean against something you can get more stable shoot even without a try that technique ha be helpful particularly when i be fortunate enough to be able to line up the shoot and use the ti ame so that my hand doe not even touch it when it snap the picture i think it be worth note that often ti jam the blur that people notice be mostly when boom in on the detail of the picture if print a a x snapshot you often will not see a problem or not enough to bother the eye at 3 megapixels that be far more resolution than be need for a x so you have to consider that it look bad when loom in other word if you have the same amount of camera shake use a low resolution 2 megapixel camera when you loom into the latter it would appear le blur but you be really look at le detail a we will have say all of that i spend a lot of ti ame try to compensate to avoid slur shake it be worth note that the camera default to normal picture quality mode i always use fine mode which double the size of the picture but reduce the peg artifact to a very low level if you can afford the memory you might a we will get the clear picture possible if you run low on memory and you know you would not need anything more than x print you can low the resolution and take quite a few more picture i only do that when i be desperate and fill up my memory which i do pretty often actually i d rather have more detail than i need rather than the other way around b accessory boy be they expensive you pretty much need to buy the power adapt and battery though not to mention a large cf card i might like to get additional filter or lens but they be a bite price also the remote shutter trigger be very expensive for a case i purchase a small low which be build tough with lot of add the 880 fit this particular model like a glove they have an entire series for digital camera that ha shoot for hold memory card battery and other handy feature b software the his nothing i think wa interest about the include software wa the li unite edition fatal file format plain use this only work a a plain to certain his not program you can load picture and enlarge them to much high resolution and it fill in detail good than typical his not software this work best if you at least have good detail in the original picture without

379;Auto;the folk at hyundai must be in the middle of a grandiose panic episode they just finish pull off introduce the hyundai santa fe into the mind sun market and now they plan on attack the highly competitive mid size sedan market head on will they accomplish it with this new entry i wonder that myself b i have first see the xg300 in a local auto show that come into town i wa i impress by the clean line and scale look though i find the overall appearance a little seat even so upon far inspection i could tell hyundai wa up to something especially when i look at the stick price a we all know however a low more doe not necessarily translate into success for a car so i decide to take the xg300 for a spin again for you san antonians the red comb s pontiac hyundai be a sleepy place and i would recommend you look elsewhere they would however have a huge volume of car i b exterior 8 i ll admit it i wa humble by this car at one point when i first saw it on the road i think it wa a lincoln at first glance from the front the xg300 certainly doe look stately complete with it be large rifle and standard fog lamp when i saw the car s profile though it be true marque wa give away yes this wa the new xg300 a i allude to previously the xg300 certainly make an i impression on those who see it however it may be a little dull for some sport the quick y wheel cover how bout some speak or something hyundai the xg300 be about the size of a nissan maxim be and large than it be little brother the sonata one of my only trouble observation wa it be thin tire although they be v rate michelins their width seem a little i amply my fear upon see this wa allow handle b interior 8 at first glance i think i wa sit in a much more expensive vehicle grant one need only a few second to realize that this be just a budget luxury car hyundai wa generous with face wood appointment and the plastic while not cheap feel certainly wa not plexus par either all of this wa to be expect of course and all in all i find the interior please to the eye the dash for instance ha a very clean appearance with a flat button layout i agitate a style you would find on high end car the radio be place high enough to be operate safely even though the coli mate control be place on the low part of the dash they we be easy to use without take my eye off the road the sterno do not blow me away but i feel it be on par with car in this class yes that include the accord and company the we will position theater produce pure high while the 6 5 door mount worker thump decent bass rear occupant may ask you to low the volume i could tell some large speaker reside in the back though i could not tell how big they we be x be my best guess the face be easy to read and use with one notable exception there be no volume knob but rather the up and down button variety i find this to be a real pain because it take a lot of push to get the volume where i want it also include be a present equalizer where you can set the level to rock live classic and flat a six d change be optional i d personally recommend it or an after market one coli mate control work smoothly and quietly it wa a hot day in san antonio but i do not notice the xg300 be room on all front head room leg room and hip room we be all i impressive this car can seat five comfortably i use that last word loosely because a wa the case during my drive of the sonata i could not seem to find a comfortable seat position the seat be joyfully lack in lumbar lateral and butt support i would easily fatigue after drive an extend period of ti ame b engine 8 the 3 ll ve church out 192hp off the line and especially on the highway i find the engine to accelerate comfortably official ti jam for 0 to 60 be around nine second which be not bad but not great either the automatic transmission shift quickly and smoothly though i find it a bite he instant at ti jam while pass it would also downshift needlessly on occasion the h magic be a standard manumatic feature where you can slide the shift away from you it should be towards you and flick the wrist up or down to shift i just leave it in automatic after play with it for a while i note hyundai ha announce a 3 ll ve will soon be come into the line up this should provide the xg300 with some i impressive go power i b ride 7 while the xg300 ride smoothly it ride perhaps a little too softly big bump will cause the whole body to undulate up and down much like the old brick once do engine noise be i impressively happen and little road or wind noise could be detect b handle 6 my rat may seem a bite harsh but i guess i wa expect good out of this car there be an appreciable amount of body roll with even moderately sharp curve and the little tire squeal if push just a little i do not feel the xg300 be a dangerous handle but it certainly will not be mistake for a sport sedan either true that be not what this car be be mark a but i still expect good break be pretty i impressive though when i hit the rake hard i could sense some fade and the nose dive quite a bite b safety b crash test be pending i ll update my review a soon a i see them b build quality 5 unfortunately i think hyundai may have a few kind to iron out here i hear a rattle come from the rear seat when i hit bump and some interior material do not look like they could stand up to abuse the door shudder and rattle when you slam them the power control do not even work every ti ame i push them not good i find this surprise because even the build quality of the economy class plantar inspire more confidence out of me when i drive it have read other professional review note the same trouble it seem i be not alone in this opinion a see country would say pity b value 8 no question the xg300 ha get an i impressive bang for your buck factor a do many hyundai car the fully load xg300 l for under 25 grand and this include standard leather seat power adjustable front seat remote sexless entry with alarm a six speaker sterno system with d player power moorhof memory driver seat and outside mirror heat front seat and an auto di aim rear mirror i would have give this car a 9 a far a value be concern but ala result value be expect to be poor do not ask me how these thing be determine if you know drop me a line but either way it doe not bone we will for when you want to sell the thing the questionable build quality may translate into a high cost of ownership but at least there be an i impressive warranty to balance some of that out b verdict there be some promise here but i d wait b the xg300 be a clear and promise indicator of where hyndai want to go with it be car however it seem to me that the company may have jump the gun with the xg300 perhaps a little patience and more extensive test on their part would have produce a good finish vehicle still for those who be look for a cheap alternative i d be hard press not to recommend you at least give the xg300 a look if it we be me and mind wa set on the xg300 i d wait a year or two in hope that build quality issue could be straighten out if hyundai come out with a sport suspension and metier tire that d be nice too b average score for the xg300 7 14 out of 10 b vara s personal rat 7 0 out of 10

387;Camera;when shop for a digital camera you probably want the most for your dollar right who doe not after do extensive research on camera find this one wa a bless while i could state a bunch of speck and fill this space with technical stuff i be sure you can go to the toshiba com web site for yourself i want a camera that have would give me clear still picture and short move have never use a digital camera before i want one that wa really easy to use this one be menu drive in short i need a camera that be si ample enough to learn on yet will allow me to take really some picture if i ever get good at photography it be a si ample camera in some respect you can use it to just point and shoot no worry about rouse though it doe that for you you can set the flash to one spot and just leave it there at this level it basically act kind of like a regular film camera here be where it get good you can set your flash to different level to accommodate for stuff like low light red eye reduction there be different mode that help you get the best picture possible while take picture of my toller i find the burst mode to be incredibly helpful it take a series of picture in quick secession good for move subject and if you have ever try to get a toller to sit still for a picture you can see how handy this be if you get really good there be a manual mode so you can mess around with set drawback unfortunately there be quite a delay from when you push the button to when the camera actually take the picture while annoy it be easily work around low light make it almost i impossible to shoot use your lead screen movie mode you can do it in low light but your movie might suck the battery ha a decent life be rechargable be good yet bad if you be out some where and your battery dy unless you have another one or use your adapt you be out of luck on the plus side we all know how expensive it can get when you have to buy battery all the ti ame what i get with my camera with my camera i receive a 8 meg smart medium card a lens cap a carry strap and software the software be really cool and make get your pick easy you just get i damage extra i do buy a lead screen protector after a few us i find that my thumb always seem to end up on the screen not want to dirty or scratch my screen i get a protector that i can replace if i have to i also buy a camera bag for it since the think of have my investment float around wa not appeal screen protector about 10 off bay camera bag i think wa 20 or so off the toshiba web site i also buy another medium card i get a 32 meg card and it do not cost more than what i would have spend in a month for film and develop picture stuff i keep my camera set to take 800x600 pick that be medium size i have it set at medium quality this allow me to take a good amount of pick and not have them look clumsy 800x600 be what most people have their computer screen resolution set at micro set can get you have close i wa able to take some neat pick of the inside of a flower without it get flurry overall i think the picture be crisp look and far good than my mmm film camera more extra there be a ton of other stuff you can buy to add to your camera do you really like the floppy disk idea you can get a floppy that you plug your medium into and get your pick that way you can get trip lens bag fast rechargers big medium card there be no shortage of accesories to buy if you want more add on disability we will i do not know about that a i ve never drop my camera i really do not think it would withstand a lot of abuse though my little brother have a very expensive until he wouldropped it about 4 foot now he ha a very expensive paper weight a long a you hold on to your camera for dear life and do not drop it i think it will last for a long ti ame overall i think it be a great camera it be few drawback be easily work around i buy my camera a a refurbish model from the toshiba web site the price wa definitely right it ha a lot of option and quality for the price tag
388;Camera;when i wa in the market for a digital camera two year ago now i have research a lot of different camera but the today do 215 stand out among the competition with it be then excellent feature and an overall great deal two year late i be still a semi happy dc215 owner but if you be think about get this camera now think again why you may ask because at this point this camera s feature be outdated and it be almost obsolete want the detail today dc215 feature a 1 megapixel cod with a x optical room while this wa more than enough then today s camera far outgrowth those specification but if you be not look for that kind of precision you may be satisfy by this camera the room work great until i have a little accident with the camera hit the lens against a table not too hard but enough to offset the focus for good there be some major shortcoming about the quality of picture in this camera for example action shoot any movement show up a a smear in the picture also do not try to take any picture at night of anything far than 6 foot from the camera you just will not see anything the connection to the computer be through a aerial cable and with the size of the picture it take forever to link up to the camera and download the picture you would be good off purchase a compactflash card reader and use the u connection the battery life of this camera be non extent if you use the lead screen to review review your picture if so expect about 5 minute until ame from the 4 a battery that go into this thing however if you would not use the screen you can get a decent amount of picture take without problem these be by far not all of the pro son of the camera just the one that be the most obvious to me a a 2 year owner of the unit i have to say that i ve take ton of good picture with it but be a scrutinize cadet person i be annoy with this camera s shortcoming and look to get something good down the road if you find that this camera will do buy it but if you want fast download long battery life and high quality picture stay away from this one

395;Camera;this wa my first digital camera purchase in august 1999 it hook me on the digital camera concept but not on this camera in particular this model be easy to use point and click on board review be nice and you can delete photo right at the camera if the shoot be no good the memory that come with the camera hold 64 photo easily that be good enough for view in the internet or about 8 high quality print some fun feature include build in frame and date print the downfall of this camera be the print resolution you can not even print even the good quality photo at big than 4 by 6 inch i unload a lot of my picture to foot com to have real print make of them and the big you can get upland to come out clear there be 3 by 5 from this camera connection be slow and i have trouble with the camera disconcert after a certain number of transfer picture the adore software that accompany the camera be easy to learn but take up quite a bite of drive space while in use do not plan on play a game in the background while you be drop and edit picture a card reader sell for about 30 separately be a smart investment make for fast unload this be a good start camera very easy to use my six year old son take good picture with this model i put about 1000 picture on this camera it keep count of how many ti jam the camera ha be use mostly for thing i sell on bay and this camera be perfect for that camera be sturdy i drop it a few ti jam loop on tile floor and the bad thing that ever happen wa the battery pop out get charge battery this camera eat them in about 60 picture take 4 a br br
396;Camera;this be my first digital camera what sell me wa the feature i like the fact that the camera us regular a battery not a price proprietary battery like some camera do so in a pinch you can find battery anywhere you can buy rechargeable nickel metal hydrate do not use ricans battery and a charge inexpensively at radio shock i also like the fact the camera us compact flash memory card again widely available this camera can use up to a 128 meg card some camera only have internal memory which mean when you fill up the memory you can not take any more picture until you wouldownload them to your computer and ease them from the camera s memory it also ha a x optical room a digital only room basically just crop the picture so the resolution suffer the camera also ha a lot of set that can be define by the user flash white balance power set etc it be get a lot of option but good have your manual handy until you get familiar with them all it also come with a u cable so you can download the photo to your computer and the canon software be pretty decent i think that a 1 3 megapixel camera would not produce quality photo but i wa pleasantly surprise at the high resolution set this camera take excellent sharp picture a friend of mine recently enlarge several of my shoot to 8x10 and print them out on his printer at work on photo paper the result we be amaze i have always read that you could not enlarge picture take with a 1 3 megapixel camera beyond x and even that wa stretch it do not believe it the 8x10 s he make we be sharp than the x print i usually get use 400 a film this camera will take picture in near total darkness but shoot take in poor light will tend to be somewhat grain however the quality of picture take in decent light be i impressive the result be crisp clear we will expose and have nicely saturate color the battery life be about average and there be a fair amount of parallel error when you be use the viewfinder instead of the lead the lead can be hard to see in bright light also if you be look for your first digital camera you absolutely can not go wrong with one of these it be load with feature and will not cost an arm and a leg canon ha discontinue this model and they can be have cheap if you can find one i love this camera
397;Camera;first off the picture associate with this camera on opinion com be not a picture of the visitor 3745 for an actual picture of the 3745 go to visitor com i research this camera and could not find any review but it have all of the option that i wa look for so i figure that for the price it would be a good deal i wa wrong i purchase this camera on palmar com for 229 i get both the visitor 3745 a 3 1 meg fix camera and a free 128 mb sd card delivery wa cheap and fast i order on a thursday night and receive it the follow tuesday morning the cost of 2 day ship wa le than 5 this wa my first digital camera and i wa look for something to supplement my 5 year old automatic canon mmm camera i be not a photography expert so i just want something that wa si ample to use and take picture that would be somewhat comparable to my canon mmm for the last 4 year i have be pay to have all of my mmm picture put on disk when i get them develop my goal with go to a digital camera wa to save money on develop by put the picture on a disk myself and only have the best picture print include in the package we be digital photo edit software the camera a camera case a lens cap a wrist strap a cord to connect the camera to your pp via a u port a cord to connect the camera to your to via a sca connection and 4 a alkaline battery the 128 mb sd card which i believe wa a palmar com exclusive deal ship separately but arrive on the same day when you first turn on the camera you have to enter the date and ti ame which wa easy to do but unfortunately this have to be do every ti ame that you change the battery and i have to change the battery often the venus on the camera we be easy to use and i like the fact that in addition to the picture review lead screen on the back of the camera the top of the camera have a small screen which display the i damage resolution the number of remain picture that could be take at that resolution and the remain battery life if the indicator wa correct you could take around 140 picture at the high quality resolution on a 128 mb card in addition to take still photo the camera also allow you to take video without sound in the quickly ame format a 128 mb sd card will hold about five and a half minute worth of video i own this camera for a week and take about 150 different still picture in various set inside outside and in various light and about 12 different short video all of the still picture regardless of the light we be dark and pixelated look the video we be somewhat pixelated but they seem to be of good quality than the still picture i expect a degree of pixelization on the video after all this be a still camera and the ability to shoot video be a nice bonus but not the real purpose of the camera when my first few picture come out somewhat pixelated i think that maybe i wa use the wrong i damage resolution set but that wasn 146t the case and no matter which i damage resolution set i use my picture we be dark and pixelated the camera 146s build in flash do not seem to make any difference in the picture quality i take a number of picture at night in my live room a room that be around 15 x 20 foot regardless of whether the flash wa use or not my picture we be dark and pixelated i think that maybe the picture would be good once i download them onto my pp i hook the camera up to my pp via a u port download picture from the camera to the pp wa quick and do not require any special software my operate system be window me but the picture quality only appear bad on my pp the include photo edit software wa adequate very si similar to most of the other photo edit software out there but nothing to get excite about i try edit and i improve my photo use the include software microsoft picture it and today easyshare no matter which program i use my picture we be dark and pixelated and nothing seem to i improve them look the camera up to my 32 inch to 146s sca connection in order to view picture on the to wa easy to accomplish but something seem to cause interference and in addition to be dark and pixelated the picture when view on the to also look 147fuzzy 148 and would fade in and out the 4 a alkaline battery that come with the camera last about 20 picture i change to rechargeable ni be battery and could take about 30 picture prior to have to change battery and thus have to re enter the date and ti ame with each battery change the shutter button wa very responsive at ti jam i some jam have trouble know whether or not i have take a picture and have to stop and use the review function in order to see if i have get the shoot when take video you use the shutter button to start and stop the video but some jam i have to push the button 5 or 6 ti jam before i could get it to start or stop the video other ti jam the camera would lock up when twitch between video and still picture mode and the only way i could get the camera to work again wa to take out the battery and then i have to re enter the date and ti ame after a week i have have enough and take the camera back to my local wa mary i wa out the ship cost le than 5 but i learn an i important lesson about buy a cheap camera you usually get what you pay for this ti ame i buy a today 6340 for 279 and so far i could not be happy with it the sad thing about the visitor 3745 be that i really like the layout of the camera the function we be very intuition le than a minute after take it out of the box i wa take picture and i quickly figure out the majority of the function before open the manual latter that night unfortunately all of the picture that i take use the visitor 3745 we be not very good and nothing i do seem to i improve their quality i have to sit down and read the instruction manual before i felt comfortable use my new today 6340 which only take about half an hour to read cover to cover the today doe not have a many manual set a the visitor but every picture that i ve take with it iso far be excellent and i ve already take about 100 still picture and a half dozen short video with sound on the original set of battery

404;Camera;this be the first digital camera i ve own i ve briefly use friend in the past and learn how wonderful these thing be so this year i finally get one a a present nonetheless i be not exactly an electronic our i just know the si ample fact a an average user b power b so i get an awesome digital camera a a gift and what do i do take it out of the box and begin snap away no the sonya duc 171 us 2 a rechargeable nickel metal hydrate battery which be include with a recharger and it take up to 13 hour to charge them note the manual specify that the sonya duc 171 can not be use with regular a alkaline battery so unless you also buy the ac adapt or happen to have some fully charge nickel metal hydrate a battery handy you have to wait about 13 hour while the battery charge before you can use your camera but i do like the fact that the camera come with a recharger the camera can also be use with an ac power adapt but that be not include and must be purchase separately the manual suggest that you use the ac adapt when download your photo or print them so the camera doe not shut off in the middle of the process foi i do not get one and when the camera run out of battery it shut off without retract and close the lens and you can not retract or close the lens until you replace the battery so be sure to turn your camera off a soon a you get the low battery warn or else you could be stick with your lens open and stick out which can be inconvenient memory the picture you take be store on a they little thing call a memory stick which be short than a stick of gum the camera come with a limb memory stick which store about 96 of 640x480 picture 16 of 1600x1200 picture 10 of 2048x1536 picture not a comprehensive list but just to give you an idea i eventually buy another memory stick 128mb which cost about 80 00 look at your picture to get the picture from your camera onto your computer so you can e mail or print them you can use the video out port and the include u cable before you would this you need to install a u driver which be on the enclose d from this be quite easy and should take just a few minute if you have a sonya computer you can also just remove the memory stick and pop it right into your computer you can also look at your picture on a television with the include sca video cable instant slide show of your vacation picture anywhere there be a television picture quality the sonya duc 171 ha a resolution of 3 2 megapixels i be not sure exactly what this mean but it appear that the more megapixels you have the good your picture quality without much experience with other digital camera all i can say be that my picture look really great when i print them on photo paper use my ink jet printer they look almost a good a a mmm print to me great color and crisp i damage i do have a chance to compare my sonya photo with the photo i take with the polaroid do 640 which ha le than 1 megapixel and what a world of difference room the sonya duc 171 ha an optical room of x and and digital room of x for total room power of x i think the 160mm room on my mmm camera wa a little more powerful but the x room on the sonya duc 171 be just fine for what i need design ease of use the camera be a good compact size and fit nicely in my hand and all the control like the mode dial the control button and the room button be we will place and comfortable to use i also have no trouble with the menu or the other function of the sonya duc 171 after just a few minute with the manual it wa easy to figure out how to do everything i want i wa able to begin use the camera right away once the battery we be charge that be so this camera be easy to use even for a newby like me movie i wa surprise to discover that you can record little move with the sonya duc 171 which you can download a peg file onto your computer there be no sound and the picture quality be not great so it be hardly a substitute for a camcorder and nothing more than a fun little i ammick but it be handy if you ever want to send a little digital forage via e mail miss aside from the initial cost of the camera i expect that most people will want to invest in some accessory to enhance their use of the camera memory stick 128mb about 80 90 each extra ni be battery about 6 8 for a package of 2 case model le up about 20 from sonystyle com ac adapt about 40 from sonystyle com all in all i be really happy with the sonya duc 171 this will be a great convenient way to keep and share my memory for a long ti ame to come

409;Auto;this car really ha me spoil it will probably outlive me seriously my 93 tooth coolly ha really be worth every cent i originally spend on it i buy it use in 1994 it wa my first car i read all the review for car in it be class and it seem to be the best value for the cost it ha live up to all my expectation my little coolly ha be so reliable for me it ha never break down on me never leave me strange anywhere it be be a far north a new york i live in ohio and a far south a south carolina with 0 problem besides the usual his notenance and replacement tire rake i have not really have to do much with it it be still get about a much zip in it a when i first get it it still look good no problem with rust yet even in our nasty winter i still love the look of it much good than the late model the inside be just a good a the outside nice look interior the control be easy to reach and to work my automatic transmission ha it be gear shift on the floor it be convenient and easy to use i get great mileage too the heat system keep the car copy when it be need and the a c doe it be job just a we will there be plenty of leg room up front and in the back comfortable for four people there be plenty of room in the trunk a we will the only drawback might be if you be look for a huge interior it be just right for four people to fit in comfortably a fifth person could squeeze into the back but it get a little tight for a compact car though it really be adequate overall i really can not say enough about it i love this car i would definitely buy it all over again br br
410;Camera;i ve be use this camera for an year and hence my comment be not from the first look but from usage of several month if you be look for a camera which ha the best dollar per fix value then this be the winner but if you be look for convenience disability good quality picture for all light condition keep away from this take good picture in daylight but one ha to work hard to get a non shake picture in poor light condition battery life be about average the good part be that it run on regular a battery so you can get them anywhere but the bad part be that you have to carry lot of them with you when you go on a trip i be not sure if this ha a charge inside but the camera do not come with any ac adapt there be a do in socket on the camera which mean there would be an optional ac adapt from today to use with this camera for an extra price but i be not sure if that can charge the battery if we use rechargeable a battery the size of the camera be big for it be feature come on today designer what we be you think digital camera do not need a film compartment a motor to advance remind the film all they need be circuit to record data onto a memory card an lead screen and a flash and that be it the size could be much small on this with the camera be light weight and big in size you get a plastic hollow feel when you carry this camera even with this big size of the camera the battery compartment be very tight it be barely big than the size of the battery a a result the tension on the spring be very high cause an overcoat on the small plastic cover that hold the battery my battery compartment break with first month of it be use i now use duck tape to cover my compartment i be not alone in this area my brother who ha the same camera ha break battery compartment too camera feature be very we will decide in the design cut down all the non sense and give only require to an average user cannonade picture in two different resolution set on to in build memory or to an external compact flash memory i use an limb external memory to take more than 300 picture during one of my vacation on this camera it take little while to record the picture after you release the shutter but i think it ha more to do with the speed of the memory than the camera it itself i use a cheap memory and hence it might be of le speed it ha an in build flash not very powerful but of average power the interface software which download the picture into your pp wa si ample to use and easy to understand it ha some bag though in my window up i can not download to the same old all the ti ame i have to let it create a new old every ame i download picture i would have like a u interface or a fireside interface aerial port be too slow i have to wait for considerable amount of ti ame before the picture be download to my pp it doe not an optical room epi nominate the need of a motor here and another question on why that big size it ha a video out cable ha to be purchase extra to connect to a v and record the video no audit i would only recommend this if you want a digital camera for a bargain price
411;Camera;first of all i just have to say before purchase this wonderful camera i read the review that people post on this page i want to see what wa the overall opinion of this camera many have complain say that be give them problem but after read what the problem we be i have realize that it wa not the actual camera but other thing that have cause the problem i buy the camera and i must say i have never be more please i use to own be agra clay click and wa not please at all so that be why i decide a change the main reason i need a digital camera be because i take picture for a webster mainly the picture be of party in the dark during the night i need a camera that take great quality picture even in the night ti ame the per may wa exactly what i wa look for i read review where people have complain that the camera ha a low flash which be completely untrue this camera ha different flash set include a night feature which take bright and clear picture even in low light another great thing that i have notice be that you cannonade black and white picture this make it more fun and interest to explore the different picture style i already take a b w photo of my puppy and let me tell you it be the chest picture ever the camera it itself be pretty small it be easy to hold and come with a neck strap i wish it have come with an ac adapt but those can be purchase for like 12 at radioshack so it be not a problem i have see that many have complain about the u cable and say that it doe not work mine work just fine i just think something be wrong with those people u port on their computer and that be why they have problem with it i have already transfer many pick onto my computer and the u cable work just fine picture get transfer very quickly too the camera should have a soft case just to protect the lead the be probably the only complex not i have other than the ac adapt i buy a limb smartmedia card for 33 00 online so i do not really mind the fact that the camera come with a mb card i have a him rechargable battery pack that i have use from my other camera and i suggest use something like that just so you can have enough battery i take picture all night long at party and i need enough battery to handle the all night usage i really recommend this camera you will not be disappoint after you have it for a while make sure you play around with the different set that it ha to be sure that it work the way you want it this camera can also be upgrade you just go online and upgrade it yourself i be glad i have purchase it and for the price i get it for i think it wa more than worth it
412;Camera;so you think that you want to buy a digital camera we will have i get news for you these thing be not at all a easy a they look i think that all i would have to do be buy one of these camera and take some picture and in a dew minute i would have picture to send everyone through email that be not at all the case i go out and buy myself a nice digital camera that wa not a lot of money but yet cost a pretty good penny when i get home i sit down and read the manual that wa only about four hundred page long and only take me all day to read then i think that i have it but this wa only the start once i take a picture which only take me about an hour to figure out how to do i try to down load it to my computer this wa one of the hard thing i have ever try to do which be probably because i be not too good on the computer any way after awhile i finally figure it all out i think that this probably be one of the best digital camera because it ha a great picture that come out and be very clear i guess that i make a good choice when i buy this camera for my need but feel that i should have just keep my money if i have to tell a friend if they should buy a digital camera i think i would have to have them over and try to use mine and see if they would be able to handle one br br

i would feel comfortable have my family in the windsor ha many safety feature such a a senior system that provide the proper level of inflation for the dual stage driver and passenger airbags the li unite edition windsor ha side i impact airbags for both the passenger and driver these sensory determine just how much energy should be use to deploy the airbags accord to the severity of the accident another standard safety feature be the a tire warn system that alert when the tire pressure be low one of the optional feature be the all speed traction control that help his note contraction on slippery road how about the power heat signal mirror that contain a light arrow that alert traffic behind to you lane change these also flash when the slide door be open people behind you know that someone be leave the vehicle the first i have ever see be a conversation mirror that be on the overhead console that allow you to see the kiss in the back seat with out your attention leave the road foot medal that move i guess one auto dealer realize we be not all the same height the brake and accelerate medal move the driver can position them at their own comfort level would not that be nice not have to move the seat each ti ame another driver take over maybe the best safety feature be the low anchor and others for child latch the 2000 windsor achieve a five star government front crash test rat for the driver and front passenger ok what do i really love about this van the entertainment system in the back seat if that have be available when i have young child think of the gray hair

journey the kiss be tire pop in their favorite video game and they will be happy for the last two hundred mile the drive can put a soothe d in and enjoy the remainder of the trip the windsor ha an be be sterno and a 6 disc in dash d change with a clock my hot cup of fresh coffee will sit perfectly safe in the self adjustable cup holder now i be forever chase my hot cup of coffee across the dashboard and also catch it frequently on quick take off the base price of this very useful and versatile vehicle be 33 570 add the auto vision family entertainment system an additional 995 00 make the total price 35 220 the gas mileage be 18 in town and 24 highway the fuel tank hold 26 gallows of fuel the windsor ha 3 ll spy ve engine and the 4 speed automatic transmission on the highway there wa plenty of power for pass the front ha a stabilizer bar and macpherson strut front suspension there be a twist bean rear suspension for a van it roll into the turn nicely the windsor have a solid feel to it the windsor wa very easy for me to get up into in fact of all the car trunk and van we look at that day the windsor we be the easy i love the side door it open so easily it have a power slide door it close with just a touch of a finger i remember so many ti jam with my dodge caravan have an harmful of stuff try to get the dark door open the power door be sensational the li unite edition windsor have 215 65r16 bow self seal tire and a full size spare tire the self seal tire be a pretty neat feature i remember play with one of these at a tire shop one ti ame they have a board with 3 nail on it that sever into the tire each ti ame the puncture would seal i immediately i offend wonder how many puncture that tire end up with when it wa take down a a demonstration and if it still hold air this van will hold 7 people and still ha plenty of additional storage space the model we try have bucket seat in the first and second row and a bench seat in the third row the li unite addition ha many interior and exterior accent that set off this vehicle rather nicely to top all this off it ha a sexless entry with a keypad the windsor come standard with a class ii owe package and a 2 000 3 500 le owe capacity i believe this to be plenty adequate to tow a medium size boat though i be a bite very about the ve engine and if it would have enough power to tow a medium size boat i would just hate it if i we be the person slow down a long line of traffic on a mountain pas it sure doe aggravate me when i be at the back of a slow line the li unite edition windsor we be consider be a black with clear coat and mineral gray two tone the 10 speak brush aluminium wheel set it off very nicely the ford no deductible jumper to jumper 3 year or 36 000 mile warranty be accompany with the 24 hour emergency roadside assistance program i would have like an option of a ve engine i really do not think the ve will do everything we will require it to do i like the functionality of the windsor i especially like all the safety feature i always compare vehicle and their safety feature by think to myself would i use this automobile to bring a new baby home from the hospital in the li unite edition windsor i think i would be comfortable bring a new baby home i love the open road i get very anxious after just a short period of ti ame of not be on the open road just set the wind behind me and i could go forever that be exactly what i intend to do someday be travel and see everything i can see until i finally get tire of go
414;Camera;i be guess you have read a few other review already and be no doubt familiar with the feature and speck of this camera so we will deal with live with it i originally purchase this camera around fifteen month ago a a gift for my wife a she have take a shine to my 1 imp polypus d 150 while this camera wa large it offer 2 imp resolution and more non menu control feature she love this camera and it give birth to an interest in photography which i have encourage and nourish by trade her up to a canon go this christmas while i inherit the and and our daughter now ha the d 150 in general photography the result from this camera be more than adequate to satisfy the average amateur user and only the li agitation of it be available feature prevent the more artistic use of an enthusiast however i must qualify this by state that we would use powerful photo edit software at home and can correct exposure problem color cast or composure prior to print this mean that we can operate to a wide tolerable than some if you intend to just use the shoot a be you may depend on your personal taste find the result mildly over expose around 1 2 stop but this can be adjust on the camera to suit yourself never have use the software supply with the camera i can not comment on it i use a digital camera peri angrily for work i be an electrical engineer for a machine manufacturer and be require to carry out field work to prove new design investigate possible design issue and commission of modify prove product this give me a requirement for take technical photography shoot to expound upon what i have observe in the field frequently these shoot be take internally to machinery and under very poor light condition i frequently use the micro mode and some be even take blind with the camera at arm length even under these circumstance i can normally produce the evidence i need quickly and easily at home we use a card reader to download the i damage and have do so since we have have the camera no one seem to know where it be call be now so when i recently have to produce some i damage quickly at work for a bring a lack of proprietary cord let me down have it be a standard u like polypus camera this would not have happen i have since purchase a pp card adapt for the cf card so i can now load the i damage directly into my lawton personally i find the menu option le easy to use than the polypus version but my wife view thing the other way round so i guess this be just a matter of personal taste and familiarity like most digital camera especially when use the screen a lot battery life wa poor then my friend tell me about photolife energy e photo lithium battery these be around twice the price of standard alkaline but be design for this use and last fantastically we will i find myself change battery around every two month now rather than about weekly a it wa before so now i have no complex not there also the supply memory card be hopelessly inadequate and wa quickly replace by a limb unit a i only shoot with the mind alum compression possible this at least allow me to take a reasonable number of shoot 65 a oppose to 7 a supply fortunately these be now reasonably price but when think of buy factor in the price of additional memory in summary much a though i hate to let the camera do the think for me the nature of my usage require it to be so this camera ha never let either my wife or myself down continually produce result within the li admit we operate with easily

let me elaborate on some of the problem and explain them a little far in october of 1999 i have to have the car hood top and trunk re his note because for some reason the his not start just ship off when you wash it or just rub it and it wa down to the metal on the car we take it into the dealer and of course they would not want to his not it and say that we get something on it but my husband be the type of person he be that doe not like to be accuse of something that he would not do fight with them about it and finally the man say bring it back on this day and the regional manager will be here to make a decision about the car so we go up there on that day and the man never show up so they have to his not our car they tell u it would be about 5 day and give u a rent car we will 5 day turn into one month and then when i get the car back whoever puff it out scratch the side of the door all up from the button on there jean so i have to once axis take it back and have more work do on it to get those out they never would tell u why the his not do that iso we get no explanation for that a far a the seat farmer go out like they have and be repair a many ti jam a you can see above still to this day do not work we just get feed up with them not be able to solve a si ample problem like a seat warm shout out and give up the driver side work but the passenger seat doe not work the light would shoot spark out when try to use they say that it have a short in it and replace it the plate that be under the gear shift crack in half when i put the car in gear why i do not know they never would tell me all they say be it get hang on something underneath and crack it they never want to tell you why something happen to your car when they know why then i start have problem with the car front end pop when the brake wa apply we will i only write down two ti jam above that i take it to the shop but i take it more than that i just do not have the receipt to actually see when i take it in anyway we take it to several place and they all say it wa different thing so naturally each ti ame we take it to a new dealer they never fix it finally we take our chance and take it back to once last dealer in richardson texas that ha outstanding rat for fix car and to our amazement they fix it and even drive it around for 15 minute to make sure it wa fix before they call u to come get it and mind you this wa the manager that do this to ensure we would not have the problem with them not fix it a we would with everyone else and last but not least i will describe thing that i do not like about this car and thing that i do like first i do not like this car because it ride rough most of the ti ame but it doe have good day and the least little bite of wind catch underneath and will whip you right off the road if you be not careful the original tire that come on the car really we be terrible but i love this car because it be room speak have a great radio the air work great and theater a we will the seat feel great when drive and sit they seem to make you feel like can just slide right in with no problem and drive hundred of mile without be uncomfortable i like the fact that the seat come down in the back so that you have access to your trunk because this car ha a huge trunk and it be very deep and when something fall to the back you can not reach it from the outside of the car you have to pull down the seat to get to it all the mirror seem to be put in the right place and right for short people like me the fact that the seat can adjust to right not just up and back be great now that all the problem have be fix in this car it be great i have not have any problem out of it since the last car dealer fix it i also get my car when they first come out so i expect there to be problem with it be fresh on the market

418;Auto;i pick up my brand spain new f350 it longbox superb saw powerstroke x about 3 week ago and i ve get nothing but good thing to say about it the diese engine be fantastic for owe i use this truck to pull my land rover around on a flash and i can coli be grade like there be nothing back there this motor also get pretty good mileage though not a good a i d hop i ve be see about 15 18 pg depend upon condition the downside to the diese be that it be a it more expensive to buy and b it really loud my i do not think my neighbor like the fact that it sound like i be fire up a freightliner every morning when i leave for work the interior be spacious and comfortable if you would not slide the front seat all the way back there be room in the half size rear area for real people not the midge they usually have in mind when they be desire extend cab i have a friend back there for an 8 hour drive and she would not complain at all about it actually she get the sweet deal because she could lie down but whatever i have to sand bag the bed when i be not carry a load because the spring be pretty stiff when it be empty not a big deal but certainly something to be aware of i go with the one ton because i figure that someday i might carry a cab over hamper if you would not need the load carry ability i d definitely go with the 250 i ve get the heavy service suspension and you really do need to get run board with this suck i do not have them yet and it be a choose for me to coli be into this truck i be 6 2 quit my mother 5 6 quit find it nearly i impossible to get in this be a really expensive vehicle when you get the diese and a reasonable comply agent of option by the ti ame i wa out the door i d pay about 38 000 complex not when the center front seat back be down act a a center console anything you put under it on the seat will slide back and fall off the seat onto the floor behind this mean there be really no good place to put thing like cell phone where they can be hear and readily access i ve get to come up with a solution for this one i get a bunch of flush gravely snow splash on the side of the vehicle and when i late go to roll down the window the sand get between the seal and the glass and scratch it all to he will you would think they could build a seal that actually keep the sand out it b it br br
419;Auto;i buy a 2002 ellipse because i have a 1992 ve be that i have to get rid of due to the birth of my daughter now that she no long require attention while i be have to mentally shift year i have me another one i find the ve it to be a lot tight than the 1992 i have my husband and i recently go on an 1 100 mile trip in the car to far west texas we find ourselves repeatedly lodge deer raccoon jackrabbit wizard and any other write that happen on the road the ellipse hug the curve stay on the road and respond quickly and this wa at speed of 80 90 mile per hour it be also quite a bite quiet with very little road noise or engine noise the clutch and gear shift be soft and quick i do not have any problem with grind while shift when i skin a gear the sound system be nice my daughter car seat fit nicely in the back and i do not have problem get her out i can fit more stuff in my ellipse than i can in my status i would recommend this car for a responsible mature driver i would not recommend it for a teenager the car will flat get away from you give the chance
420;Camera;we will the first opinion will tell all of the feature of this camera so i will talk a bite about the i damage quality and make a few comparative statement the very first thing i notice when i pull this camera out of the box be that it be the sharp look camera i have ever see so if look be i important to you then check this baby out i print out a 8 5 x 11 inch print on a dye sub printer and compare it to a si similar print do from the full 4700 the 4700 have excellent close up detail but small text in the background though legible wa not sharp the 6800 have even good close up detail and i could clearly read all of the small text license plate in the background there wa a whole lot le pixelization in the 6800 color reproduction wa also very accurate the color in my print we be just about dead on without any manipulation at all now we cannotalk a bite about boom ratio with digital camera resolution ha a huge part to play in the boom capability of the camera the high the resolution the more detail you will see and therefore the more you can signify the i damage this be basically the same concept a use fine grain film to get a big enlargement you can signify a 100 a film much more than you can an 800 a film likewise you can signify a 6 megapixel i damage more than you can a 1 megapixel i damage so the point i be get to be this the effective boom ability of one camera can be compare to the effective boom ability of another camera by multiply the resolution by the optical room and then si amply see which one come out with the big number for instance you have a 1 up camera with a x optical room 1 ti jam 3 be 3 then you have a 3 up camera with a x optical room 3 ti jam 3 be 9 so the 3 up camera ha 3 ti jam the effective optical boom ability of the other camera so now you can do the path on the 6800 yourself and compare the room to any other camera out there the path above may easily be confuse with digital room however they be not the same thing the above formula be si amply a way of link the actual enlarge capacity of the i damage to the telephone capacity of the lens digital room ha nothing to do with the lens on the camera in fact i would say that digital room should not even be take into consideration when buy a digital camera your computer can do the digital boom after you transfer the i damage onto your hard drive and the computer can do it fast and to the exact area you want it to and it will not eat your precious battery power by the by the 6800 us full s no 80 battery which mean excellent battery life and the ability to charge the battery without remove it from the camera
421;Auto;the body of this car hasn t fall apart while i be drive by a mere miracle he a c vent have fall off the arm rest be break the window seal and door seal have un glue themselves from the car it be all a mess you would think it be a 1980 by the look of the fall body part it be good to use this car be scar move the transmission wa just replace an the fuel tank wa replace let me see whatelse the rake have be replace and rotary over 4 ti jam within a 3 year range and get this the car only ha 46 000 mile why so little mileage we willllets see it ha probably spend 60 of it be life with me at the dealer and not friable because of the continuous engine problem the engine light come on the oeverdrive light turn on it choke and it ha be bow about 20 ti jam that mexico tell me one more to and i will loose my owe privilege for that car we will it be not my fault the car ha leave me strange whatelse be i to do just avoid all kiss please
422;Auto;you may have read my initial review of the 2001 focus x where i land the car s i impressive feature for the price i impressive handle say and comfort to say i be disappoint six month and 7 000 mile into my ownership experience be a gross understatement this vehicle ha spend 16 day in the shop because of a variety of fuel system and transmission problem use manual the leadership initially insist that there wa nothing wrong with the transmission and that they could not duplicate my complex not after do exhaustive internet research i find that the transmission problem affect almost every focus with the 5 speed manual i also find that although ford initially deny there wa any such problem the company ha recently issue a service bulletin regard gear follower noise gear follower cause a distinct chatter from the transmission the car sound like an old diese engine there be no doubt that the noise will substantially i impair the trade or result value of this car and it suggest that a more serious transmission problem be yet to come ford say the noise be normal gas consumption be much le than ford clay a under all drive condition the engine lose rum and stumble a if it be go to stall at almost every traffic light my dealer ha be unable to fix the stumble there be a noise come form the cargo area which sound like a mechanic leave a french or something inside the body i be file for the lemon law hear this week i highly suggest you run a word search in the send archive and check out the problem people be report with their focus
423;Auto;say i have to say in my opinion i really do not like the say of the i ample it be traditional genetic over say typical for a general motor vehicle but obviously it doe not offend those loyal to the blue bowie mark because it be one of chevrolet s best sell model safety safety feature standard be dual front airbags for both front passenger a driver s side side arbat be optional i have no idea why chevrolet offer a driver side only side arbat other than they might be afraid that a child will be sit in the passenger s front seat and the child could be lean toward the arbat increase their chance of injury from it however other car company have go around this by just instal a senior in the seat that deactivate the arbat if someone be lean in it be path most likely it be just typical go bean count they would not want to invest the ti ame or the money in develop the seat senior so they just do not put a side arbat for the passenger in at all also recently go ha delete standard a on many of their model safety rat the i ample ha do we will on all it be crash test it receive a dual five star frontal crash test rat from the government side i impact test we be excellent a we will four star for front and rear passenger the insurance institute for highway safety his give the i ample a good rat in it be frontal crash test handle there be a major difference in handle between the base model and the be try be line the base model ha a marshmallow like suspension that doe not promote good stability at highway speed the be ha a more aggressive tune suspension which be a bite firm and it doe not compromise the ride at all the i ample doe not come close to it be competition at all in term of handle mainly the accord and pass but those step up from the lamina will be more than happy ride like many go product in the past both the base and be model suspension be overlay soft the base model be the bad the ride on the highway be comfortable but leaf you wonder what would happen if you have to make an evasive maneuver at high speed the be s ride be si similar to that of the base model only more control if i have to serve around an object at highway speed i would not be worry about it at all in an accord or a pass but i d be really worry how the base model i ample would handle this situation build quality you would think that chevrolet would catch on to the reason why hand and tooth be out sell them build quality be horrible the dash ha large gap between panel and the material themselves be not exactly of good quality the leather on the seat be thin shiny and rather cheap feel and so be the add underneath them the his not job wa not bad but the panel gap we be large compare to it be competitor one problem we have have on our i ample be that we have to have the front door re hang on their hinge because they begin to say so badly that we have to lift the door up slightly to close it iso we would not damage the car the driver s side door be sound like it need to be re hang again at only 24 000 mile the dealer tell u this be normal and they have have to do it to many other i ampalas interior a i have say in the build quality section it leaf much to be desire a far a quality economics be average and so be the seat roominess be one of the i ample s strength there be more than enough room for all passenger the reflection of the sun from the dash be horrible you would have think they learn from the previous model that this be not safe and very distract on sunny day audit the sound quality come from the speaker be horrid high might a we will be non extent the midrange be lack to say the least the bass the bad and most annoy think about this sound system seem ok at low level but turn it up a little past normal and everything become muddy and distort needle to say i do not listen to the radio in this car engine there be two to choose from a 3 ll v 6 or a 3 ll v 6 the first engine offer a meager 180 horsepower that move the base model adequately the be try be line give 200 more horsepower which allow the i ample to compete much good with other car in it be class value go be try to up the value with this car by offer 0 air for sixty month which may attract many look to buy in this segment however i would choose the accord carry or pass over this car any day overall the i ample be basic transportation and there be car that offer good quality and design for the same money if your think of buy the i ample make sure you wouldrive the competition first when the lease end next year we will not be sad to see this car go
424;Auto;the 1999 grand cherokee codenamed the quit we quit to jeepheads be the first design of the grand cherokee since it be introduction in 1993 the quit j quit model day adler chrysler go all out on this machine hire porch to do the bodywork you cannotell it be much more aerodynamic than the previous generation particularly when they be mark side by side the brand new ve engine be more powerful than the previous and more fuel efficient too not include the 1998 li unite 5 9 late model though the interior be very nice and the drivetrain we will the drivetrain be what iso many love and hate about the vehicle the drivetrain of a vehicle be it be heart and soul it can make or break a car you can have the bad interior the bad economics but one neck of a drivetrain and the car will be famous and love by many and desire by many more case in point the viper you could also have a car with the best interior the most luxurious appointment ever design but have a really poor drivetrain and the car will flop ok so i can not think of any case here i guess if you spend that much money design the interior you will hire someone competent to do the driver not the grand cherokee s new drivetrain be a mix bless the design of the quarry drive be nothing short of sheer brilliance a 4 5 speed transmission 2 and year for shift and downshifting viscous differential all the way around so if 3 wheel completely lose traction one will still have it despite what they may clay be no production and car ha this capability it be quite si amply astound particularly in very poor road or off road situation it be like have detroit or arm at your beck and call sorry deep teach speak slip in there the problem be spot quality there be numerous complex not about the drivetrain fail mostly due to poor quality control with the part that make the viscous count differential or the transmission it itself i have hear numerous quit fix quit for these problem in all the message board i ve hang around in but there seem to be no sure fire bet the funny thing about it if you can call this funny be that a grand cherokee will be complete heaven or complete other place throughout it be life most at least 90 of grand cherokee 99 owner have have 0 problem with the vehicle and judge from the past performance of grand cherokee they never will it be those 10 that get a faulty one that have the problem no matter what they would to try and fix it the problem always come back every ti ame every case not only be this frustration to the owner but the mechanic go absolutely fatty try to figure out what be cause the problem to keep re appear i know some of the best mechanic in the u that can completely change around a vehicle or build a brand new one from the grind up with nothing more than si ample paper sketch and they have not be able to figure it out do car have arm if you get a good one you will absolutely fall in love with it head over heal it be honestly that good if you get a bad one you will rue the day you wouldecided to purchase one and can not understand why so many people like them so much so write an opinion on this vehicle be particularly tricky on one hand it be a marvel of engineer and if you get a good one quite si amply nothing will stand up to it in comparative test and it be just a joy to drive on road or off it be quiet a a daddy the ride be smooth a silk for an sun the engine performance be superb and even the gas mileage be good than expect the seat be come etc etc etc if you get a bad one we will such it eventually to me boil down to the ever burn question quit would i recommend this vehicle to a friend quit and the answer be i si amply do not know 90 odds be fairly good but would you really put a friend into a position where there be a 10 chance that they could be work and consider that the problem would not make themselves clear until after a few thousand mile at least it be not like they could be detect on the lot so test drive one si amply will not work if chrysler s customer service wa a good a it should be and replace those vehicle that be faulty instead of try to nitric them to death or si amply ignore the owner and hope they will go away i would recommend one whole heartily so while this review will have a quit not recommend to friend quit on it i still think it be a fine vehicle and if you want to take the risk go for it this review be probably one of the hard i ve ever write anywhere since i be a hard core deep guy my cherokee ha 260 000 mile on it and i still love it but i do place credit where credit be due and i also put blame where blame be due a we will if you have any doubt i would wait until the next model year and see if do ha decide to seriously investigate these problem because until they would i have no choice but to avoid the vehicle that i want to buy when i retire br br
425;Auto;i have own a 1998 mitsubishi 3000 it base model for a year i purchase it brand new with all option include leather and infinity sound system at a great price with the 100k extend warranty basically this car should have never be make who put a 160 he ve in a 3350 le car it be very sluggish and slow off of the line although i find good acceleration compare to an escort in rd and th year at first suspension and handle seem good but only if you be go straight it take corner at high speed poorly for a high performance sport car also if you try to break around a corner the break lock up i have have this happen to me three ti jam all lead to accident by the way anti lock break be not even an option on the base model my car do not last long enough for me to test it be engine reliability but many electrical part have to be replace within the first year the only thing go for this car be it be look overall i would not even consider this a sport car it ha a galant engine and lack of antilock rake in such a heavy car make it extremely safe it fit two people and maybe a ruffle bag in the trunk do not even try to fit a small suitcase in the trunk or a passenger in back seat unless they be you master they will not fit even small child complain i learn my lesson if you want a 3000 it buy the or now i know why they wouldiscontinued this model it wa one of the most reliable and safe car i have own br br
426;Camera;i be a little ashamed to admit i wa first attract to this camera by it be look body snub nose brush metal retro look beautiful after do a lot of research on this camera and read the excellent review here by mbfd316 and keith 2000 i make the purchase decision in it be price range i really do not think there be a good camera before this i ve buy and use camera by polypus three of them union coolpix sonya st generation mavra and others if you have window up set be more automatic than you can i imagine plug it in up find it identify it a a u storage device and install driver you would not even need the supply driver or software please make sure to click the remove hardware icon in your system tray and stop this u device before plug it the world will not end if you forget this but it sure will not hurt you be then give the choice of launch whatever i damage edit software be in your computer begin edit or si amply launch window up s explorer to drag drop photo for window case you may be ask to insert the supply d then click enter to let window find and install the driver some of the review i read around the internet on this camera complain of le than cellar performance in low light i have find this to be at least a good a most or many digital camera in this category i even test it under no light by put it on a try at night and take a photograph of a city skyline the photograph wa great all point n shoot camera be go to have some li agitation in poorly light indoor set any camera that attempt to use a tiny build in flash will inevitably encounter li agitation particularly digital you just have to remember to keep your subject we will light for indoor photo test this camera indoors with exist light i ve find it to be possible and no bad than what be normal in the point and shoot world feature i ll begin by say that this camera ha some great one most notably the ability to adjust your a iso set there be also a force flash or fill flash capability a we will a conceal flash and even a low light son mode which i test in a night photo with great result adjustable white balance and manual adjustment to exposure compensation from minus 1 5 to plus 1 5 in third step increment be great for a camera in this price range micro capability be outstanding here i be amaze at how close clear and sharp my extreme close up be video out have the video out capability mean you can record your little clip and photograph to video tape and send them to friend and relative who do not even have a computer stability this camera be easy to use in the automatic point and shoot mode some will complain about the lens cap just make sure you have it tether to the camera with the supply cord and you will be alright overall i wa amaze at the care with which this wa package it wa definitely intend to be a quality offer and it be the owner s manual be a book about an inch or two thick and weigh nearly a pound detail and information bonus the i amaze software supply with this camera be i damage expert which you might also know a after shoot by the excellent people at wa the people who bring you his not shop pro consider this a 49 bonus it be excellent software make specifically with digital camera in mind i ve be print up some outstanding 5 x 7 photograph of portrait wild life and even night shoot a few 8 x 10 but that cost a lot of money in ink the costo where i live ha a process station where you bring in your smart medium card and insert it select the photo you want print take your card back then come back to pick up your print photo a few day late just a if you would drop off a roll of film i try this and be now hook on it what a fantastic benefit and at only 24 cent per print my print from the processor we be great maybe i just wa not ask enough of the digital realm but i ve get much more than i d expect with this camera if you be consider the full finepix 2600 or the canon powershot and consider this one a we will i think this a near equal and in some case good camera and a much good value

429;Camera;let me preface this review by say that i would never spend 900 on a camera digital or otherwise i do not have the money for that my wife and i receive this camera a a gift from her parent last christmas an extremely generous gift you might say we will you be correct in any event we we be pleasantly surprise to be give this camera let me explain note camera to you have briefly from a non professional photographer s point of view the camera ha a great shape to it it be small and light and fit nicely into your hand it be very aesthetically please it be silver surface and large room lens attract attention whenever i take it out when turn on there be 3 option play still and movie in play mode you be able to view all of the picture currently store on your memory stick you can do this by log through each picture 1 by 1 or by stroll through an index the picture only take about 3 second to load on the screen so patience be not require in still mode you be able to take still picture the feature that the camera offer be so numerous that i would not do them all justice besides many of them be beyond my scope of need a a casual photographer it be very si ample to switch between color b w septum and negative effect use the on screen menu the flash bulb pip up with the slide of a switch when you press the little silver button to take a picture there be an audible click that you hear that let you know you have take a picture in movie mode you be able to shoot peg move i have only use this feature once with mix result the camera actually capture the sound we will a i wa take my wife sing the video wa not the best quality but i be sure if i play with the set i could get it to be good let me reap the pro and son with this camera for you pro the camera look great be lightweight and feel good and stable in your hand pro for the first ti ame user the camera be easy to operate just turn on put in still mode and press the shutter button pro the u cable supply with camera ha work great for me picture be unload to my computer at a rate of about 3 15 second per picture depend on what resolution you have it set on pro the high resolution let you take clear crisp 8 5x11s the low set still give you clear x s pro the camera shut it itself off after 5 minute of no use so you would not waste the battery pro the mi photosuite software that come with the camera ha be very clutch for me it work great and i use it a lot con the price this bad boy be donna run you at least 900 buck if you get the money then i by all mean recommend it if you be scrap for cash you might do good get a 50 cheap at wa mary con the manual be alright but i think it could have be good write there be clot of feature that i have not explore with mine for fear of mine through the manual for the information con no case they include a brochure fear a nice case you can buy for around 40 buck but after pay all that money for the camera it be like a small slap in the face con the memory stick include be only mb this do not affect me because my in law include a limb stick with our present that be more than adequate i cannonade 50 picture at a mid level resolution and still have space leave if i only have mb i would be annoy con the battery doe tend to run out pretty fast but i like the peter which let you accurately know how long you have leave if sonya would have include a second battery they would have add a ton of value to this product con the flash be extremely bright maybe there be a set where i can change that but i have not find it yet almost every pick i take with the flash make the subject look a if they have not be in sunlight for 2 3 year i often take picture w o it and then enhance the picture and brighten them use the software supply

435;Camera;i ve be want a digital camera for almost three year since the day of high resolution 640x480 picture but would never take the plunge because the technology wa not right yet the canon go make me change my mind and be i please i buy it to make easy to read the review i ll separate it into topic 1 i damage quality that be the most i important thing for me and any top 3 3 mix camera will get you a very good picture it be still le than half the quality of mmm picture take with a good sir camera which top at about 8 mpixels but if you be donna use it digital the scan process would probably even thing out that say a 800 dollar digital camera can already take on a 200 sir 2 feature here be where this camera shine it be the only one that ha a iso 50 mode that produce great picture a with any other camera use it at 400 iso produce i damage with extreme noise so you will want to go up to 100 or maybe iso 200 but be able to view in real ti ame the effect of aperture and shutter speed compensate for it in a sense the battery be fantastic and you cannonade more than 500 picture without have to charge it i do not even think a spare be necessary unless you will be in the wild for some ti ame and there be still the raw format a loss format a la stiff that occupy 1 3 of the space an compress stiff doe very useful for you can set up white point contrast sharpness and situation without lose any i damage quality if you be take critical picture this be a gift from heaven for comparison with other camera check out this cool site www review com 3 capacity oh boy if you be go to buy this camera do yourself a favor and buy the ism microdrive what about take 130 picture in raw or 160 in peg maxim alum quality without have to unload them to your pp yes be able to use the microdrive wa the decide factor for me to buy this camera and that be for the 340mb microdrive but it be also available in 512mb and go you would the path 4 add on what i really would like be to be able to use sir lens with digital camera but that be not possible with the go in truth it be not possible with any camera in this price range you can buy a micro lens x 8 or room x 2 however it be really not worth the money it be too little for too much 5 conclusion i have some grape about it the most severe be the auto focus feature a his not use a lot le precise than the canon 1000fn sir i have and the his that be use manual mode with flash and the lead not compensation for it iso turn black at a high shutter speed aperture combination but take my word this be a great machine that will not only amaze your friend it ha happen with me all the ti ame mostly in party but also amaze you with it be feature i damage quality battery life and capacity with an add microdrive in other word if you be will to spend 800 in a digital camera go for a canon go if you be will to spend 1050 buy the go and a microdrive you will not regret it br br
436;Camera;i purchase this digital camera because i be very bad at develop film i currently have about 20 roll lay around my house wait to be develop some be from when i wa in the army in 1993 needle to say a digital camera be just what i need we wouldecided to purchase a camera with part of our income tax refund we would not know what brand we we be go to buy just yet but we would not want to spend over 300 we go to our pp on post and saw the polaroid pdc700 at 249 00 it be get a maxim alum resolution of 1024x768 and an auto ti ame most other camera in this price range i ve see only have 640x480 it doe not however have room on it it come with a 4 meg memory card 4 battery camera to computer cable camera to to cable camera case wrist strap ac power adapt ac power adapt cord polaroid potomac i damage maker software d from and polaroid potomac pro software d from i ve play with it clot in the last few day and i be very satisfy with the picture i ve hear a few people complain about the i damage quality but i have to disagree while it may not be up to par for a professional photographer for everyone else i d say the i damage quality be great it also come with an lead screen to review your picture and either keep or delete them keep in mind the i damage will look good on your computer screen than they would in the lead screen that be not to say that the lead screen be bad it be just small and picture look a bite grinder than they would on our computer monitor the software include with this camera be really fun too you cannotouch up the picture and add special effect if you would like to there be clot of effect some of which be boss oil his note and mosaic i also really like the sleek expensive look of this camera it be silvery gold and dark grey and quite compact small enough in fact that the camera case ha loop on the back so that you can slip it onto a belt this be nice for people who be in busy area and might be worry about it be steal personally i be go to sew a heavy duty strap to the inside so i can wear it like a purse since i do not wear belt the only slightly negative thing about this camera be that the battery do not last long ours last a day but keep in mind we shoot clot of picture we have learn that when we be in the house we need to use the ac adapt and save the battery for when there be not any plug around i would recommend get 2 set of rechargable battery so that while you use one set the other be always charge thus cut down on the cost of battery all in all i be very happy with the price performance and i damage quality of this camera it wa the least expensive i have find and wa nice than the other more expensive one i have look at this be one purchase i definitely will not regret br br

445;Camera;i wa die for a digital camera but my college budget cringe at the price tag of the popular band then i stumble across an ad in a mail order catalogue for the six quest dualcam at 29 after a 20 debate i could not pas it up wa it worth thirty buck we will what digital camera be not here be my take on the dualcam b hardware the quest dualcam be a palm size unit with run of the mill feature for a low end digital camera it boat a build in flash a lens cover that double a a power switch a u port for pp connection and a video output jack for view i damage on any to v with an sca input the control be we will organize in five button on top of the camera a quick run down of function a single button school through the flash option on off auto another button doe double duty a a quality elector and self ti ame switch cycle through high and low quality set with and without the ti ame there be a play record button peri angrily for use when view i damage on an external video source play mode let you view and delete i damage a expect but record mode wa a little disappoint the camera display a decent quality live fee i damage on a to but only allow you to capture still i damage several camera on the market some of the popular pen come for instance let the user capture video on the go the dualcam s web can feature however be only available when connect to a pp finally the delete and shutter button serve only their state purpose it should come a no surprise that a camera in this price range be not equip with a build in lead i damage viewer i will give six drop for the layout of their status indicator though it be easily decipher even if it be not very eye catch accessory the connection port of the dualcam bug me they be easy to get to but their position on the low leave side of the unit make use a a web can bothersome with the table connect the camera tend to shift under the weight of the cord and mean to the side why the connection we be not take around the corner to the back of the unit be beg i ve work around this problem by clamp the cord to the side of my monitor but it wa nonetheless a nuisance the optic anal solution would have be to place the connection in a cradle stand but that would probably have pack the price up the stand that be supply leaf a little to be desire it secure to the camera via a short bolt with a plastic knob on the bottom this be the same type of attachment many trip have but for a tiny webcam it be overall on a more pleasant note the dualcam come with all it be table and six even include a pair of a battery to get you start the people at six apparently appreciate the fact that it be nice to be able to play with a new toy right out of the box b performance while include battery be a nice gesture the one pair will not save you much money the dualcam be a gluttony in the power department energy in my camera have an average life expectancy of 1 2 hour thankful the unit turn it itself off after a few second of inactivity but the power drain be still i impressive i just wish i wa a i impress by the quality of the i damage a i be by the device s power consumption the dualcam offer two level of picture quality but despite my most intense inspection i can not see any real difference between low and high the only noticeable effect be that twitch to high quality drop the storage capacity from 24 i damage to 6 when transfer i damage to my pp in adore photoshop via the supply software i get 640 x 480 picture on either set at a high level of room in photoshop there be a few le fix distortion but the difference be negligible and with no option to increase memory the high set certainly be not worth the number of picture it cost the camera seem to perform best in the 6 10 foot range i ve manage some near disposal camera quality i damage at such distance and with some creative slur of background they would not look too bad the clarity however remain far inferior to an actual disposal camera and a scan wrap up there be other aspect of the unit that could be discuss one second delay between shutter press and confirmation chip two second delay between confirmation and ready light for next picture but i think the i damage quality pretty we will sum up the overall experience that be what you buy a camera for in the first place i will mention that the dualcam be adequate a a webcam capture at 30 frame second it keep up with the rest of the pack of camera webcam comb but if i have want a webcam i would have buy just that and get more focus software and option do i feel like i wa grip off no not really despite all the shortcoming of the dualcam it doe allow me to snap occasional picture and quickly access them through my pp for 29 i feel good about my purchase have i pay any more for it i might be le forgive if you be look for a high quality digital camera you will have to pay high quality price high than thirty dollar at least but if like i wa you be si amply burst at the seam to get your own digital camera the dualcam be a nice cheap start if you can find it on sale i be withhold my recommendation on the dualcam peri angrily because the quality of the i damage be so low for someone who be new to the digital camera game or who doe not require crisp photo this camera would still be pretty good for the price a a brief side note i do think this camera would make a good gift for young user it perform consistently and if it get break or use a a coster you be not out 250 on that thank for read my review i hope you have find it useful
446;Auto;the 3 series finally make sense to me recently since the current generation car appear in 1999 i 146ve have trouble get excite about it despite many opportunity to drive the car even after the engine and suspension tear a couple year ago it always seem smooth and le visceral than i felt a bow should be i want to have fun but the car wa pursue technical excellence fun and technical excellence be not the same thing i 146ve write quite a bite about my mix emotion towards the 3 series before for this review i 146ll concentrate on my recent i impression drive a 330 at a bow sponsor drive course i drive an automatic 325 wagon at the same event and a manual 325 couple at another bow event i comment on those in a review of the 2004 325 a he content 118909931140 here a b in it be sixth model year this be now the old car in the class how 146s it hold up b say and accommodation i 146ve never find the current 3 series sedan and wagon strikingly attractive the couple and convertible benefit from more ravish proportion they 146re certainly we will proportion and handsome in a very conventional manner but rely on large wheel to convey the 147driving machine 148 message a bite more edge would be nice just don 146t do anything crazy mr angle if the i improvement of the 2004 5 series over the 2002 7 series be any indication bow 146s chief designer will manage to produce a design that be both strike and attractive for the next 3 due in two year whether the result will age a we will a the current car be more dubious inside the 3 be also very conventional with the center stick can not much le towards the driver than early bow very little about the interior say 147driver 146s car 148 to me luxury receive much more emphasis than sport this be clearly an interior conceive before all of the recent tend towards novel texture and shape again if the i improvement of the new 5 146s interior over those in the old one and the 7 be any indication the next 3 will do just fine here at present however the audit a offer a high class interior while those in the cadillac it infinite go plexus be 300 and even the scab 9 3 have more character if decidedly inferior material the new acute to 146s interior be style somewhat like the bow 146s but manage to feel more up to date and porter when i think about it none of the car in this segment offer a strike high quality interior design expressly for the enthusiast so the path be wide open for the next 3 i remain le than happy with the 3 146s drive position the instrument panel and sneer column be si amply too high the new 5 doe much good in this area again hopefully the new 3 will follow for now i prefer the barrier cockpit of the japanese competition i have always felt that the 3 series 146 back seat be roomy than most people seem to realize the old 5 actually provide a fraction of an inch le rear leg room the new 5 ha a roomy rear seat make the more expensive car easy to justify that say the 3 in sedan and wagon form provide adequate room and comfort for a pair of adult in back the couple and convertible contain more marginal rear seat but i still wouldn 146t mind spend an hour or two in either the trunk be the 3 be a bite tight but useful shape fold rear seat remain an option on sedan and couple on the road make that 147on the track 148 at a recent bow sponsor two hour drive course i drive an automatic 330 sedan hard around a track set up in the pontiac silverdome park lot sadly the course wa just long enough for me to learn how little i know about drive a car we will on a track i find it especially difficult to use the whole width of the track 151in my head i want to keep to my side of the 147road 148 on a more positive note two hour wa long enough for me to realize what make the 3 series a great car the instruction session prior to track ti ame include a lot of talk about easy transition between throttle and brake so a not to upset the balance of the class and to his nothing even load on the tire yet that all go out the window on the track where the instructor command me to do thing my common sense and the prior classroom session tell me we be crazy 151hard on the throttle go deep into the turn hard on the rake back hard on the throttle with the instructor rapidly bark command i wa thoroughly grizzle thankful the car wa not aside from take out a few bone on my first fast instruction lap the instructor say he wait too long to tell me to hit the rake allow the car to enter the turn go too fast the 330 do everything it wa tell to do without any toward motion or complex not the continental tire we be another matter 151they complain almost the whole way around the track even haired with the automatic the extremely smooth wonderful sound online six 3 0 late engine felt very powerful many shipper will note that infinite and acute offer car with significantly more powerful engine but somehow in the real world their advantage largely disappear quite likely they must use tall hear to earn acceptable fuel economy my attitude towards serious horsepower depend on the transmission with an automatic i love it with a manual i often enjoy a le powerful engine a i can still charge hard through the year without end up in seriously illegal territory consequently with the manual i see a strong case for the 325 over the 330 especially since the cost difference be over 5000 you would at least get a little more for the additional cash for 2004 this year the 330 manual gain an extra gear while the 325 continue to make do with five because the sedan wa fit with an automatic i never felt a connect to the car a i would have like i 146m so use to control a car through a clutch and shift a much a through the other control that i felt like a fish out of water the whole way around the course keep both hand on the wheel at all ti jam just steer give the instructor 146s insistence on keep both hand on the wheel something else i 146m not use to i didn 146t much try to mentally shift the automatic that say although thing happen too quickly to pay much attention the automatic seem to always find the appropriate gear on it be own i certainly never felt the engine go soft a it await a downshift on the track the 3 146s class felt exquisitely balance until very near it be li amid where understeer take me into the aforementioned bone the stability control wa on which no doubt help his nothing control but i never felt it operate 151this seamlessness a good thing in it itself feedback from the medal and seat of the part wa excellent on the track the sneer 146s weigh and precision we be confidence inspire i 146d still like a quick ratio 151i suspect the next 3 will offer the new 5 146s 147active sneer 148 to resolve this issue i felt thoroughly in control of the car i 146ve mention before that the 3 feel good the hard it wa drive and on the track it wa drive very hard the tire we be scream most of the way around the track with much glitter at the rear end through fast turn exist this glitter normally would have be my due to back off 151except the instructor say 147don 146t back off 148 so aside from the class faithful communication of say glitter the car felt very very good since the track wa set up on a fairly smooth park lot ride quality wa not much of an issue but from my other experience in this car i can state that bow be we will ahead of the competition be his contain ride quality even with it be sport suspension january and audit be both decidedly inferior in this regard noise level be very low befit a luxury car but not necessarily conduce to drive fun thankful the online six make wonderful noise 151it leg to be drive hard my main issue with this car remain however to whit how much ti ame will you spend at the track in typical suburban drive the 3 series offer few thrill than many competitor it be like clark kent and sherman when there 146s no serious road work to be do the 3 put on the coat tie and glass and relax unless you regularly drive challenge road you might have more fun elsewhere of course if you si amply want to relax most of the ti ame and save the thrill for sporadic trip to out of the way road and racetrack then sign right up b new performance torment option for 2004 for 2004 bow offer a couple of new performance torment option i have yet to sample either but hope to in the near future the first be a clutch manual 151a true clutch manual not a mentally suitable automatic while this transmission also ha a fully automatic mode it be reason for be be lightning quick shift in manual mode these can be actuate use either sneer wheel saddle or a manual like shift this transmission continue to be offer in the ultra high performance my for 2 400 but will be available in the regular 3 and new 5 for 1 500 a this be only 225 more than the automatic it seem a no trainer for the drive enthusiast who doesn 146t like to use his or her leave foot i suspect the sg transmission must have disadvantage compare to an automatic likely shift smoothness or there would be no point in offer a regular automatic i plan to test drive one a soon a possible to find out the transmission become available in the 5 next march i 146m not sure when it will be available in the 3 of more questionable value be the 147performance package 148 which wa actually introduce last spring for the six speed 330 sedan and for 2004 be available with the automatic a we will for some reason it appear this package will not be available with the sg but appearance can be deceive the m tune sport suspension include in this package might we will respond to my major issue with the 3 but jump in with a modest ten horse boost to the engine 18 inch wheel a body kit and unique seat the price be 3 900 2 700 more than the sport package assume the revise suspension significantly sharpen up the car 146s handle i wish it wa available with only the usual sport package content this would bring the price down considerably prick the 3 series rank with the precede c class a the most expensive car in it be class the baby jaw be price about a high but heavy dismount and incentive take it out of the run for this 147prize 148 if you want technical excellence you have to pay for it 151in the low wa for a decently equip 330 an audit a be a bite le expensive but i find it an even more antiseptic drive experience under normal condition maybe it also come alive on the track i wouldn 146t count so much on it the audit ha a nice interior but be slow and with sport suspension ride more harshly while still not handle a we will to save some significant buck check out the infinite go in some way a more entertain if le technically excellent car the go 146s interior be significantly low in quality the new acute to price like the go in the low wa ha a good drive position and design to my eye and a sweet ve but can not touch the above car in handle the all but forget plexus be 300 be the opposite it pair agile handle with a tight cheap look even tack interior a scab 9 3 hero be price like the japanese after rebate but offer more precise handle together with good ride quality it be interior quality be below the german a touch below the acute and above the go a cadillac it be price nearly a high a the bow 3 but offer nearly a much interior space a the 5 some don 146t care for it be level of interior quality but i don 146t find it too objectionable if anything the 2004 it come too close to implicate the 3 146s class feel a i 146d like more entertainment from it a we will b last word in the end there be no perfect car in this class the best car depend on your priority in performance handle ride refinement interior room interior quality and say the bow come close than any of the others to expel on all front but i can not help wish it we be fit with a more driver torment more interest interior quick sneer and a more entertain suspension maybe the next 3 with an unbounded m tune suspension and active sneer i must admit that the 330 truly come alive on a track the problem be i don 146t spend much of my ti ame drive a car that hard if you would then my issue do not apply i neglect to mention how we will i do in the final ti amid lap head into it fresh from do everything wrong on the instruction law i fear end up dead last we will out of twelve driver i place totally mid

448;Auto;i be a repeat dodge caravan buyer my first one wa a 1995 base model it wa a wonderful van that require no service except for oil change because it have be such a dependable vehicle i never he imitate when the lease wa up i wa have nothing le than another dodge caravan this ti ame though i choose to buy a more deck out model with the sport package you learn from experience and i have find out from own the first one that if you intend to keep peace between child and have room for adult rid in the and row seat you really must have captain s chair i find the one i like and wa quite happy with it until the air condition go out in the middle of july a luck would have it i know someone else that have the same problem just day before mine go out so off to the dealer we go to replace some sort of switch that the service manager tell me have be a common problem with the 96 and 97 model van a day and a half late we we be on our merry way we will at 9 000 mile the rack and opinion on the front end have to be replace the vehicle wa le than 6 month old and i have only put 6 of those 9 thousand mile on it since i buy a dealer domo we will they tell me it would be at least 3 day and i would have to rent a car i wa not very happy and to make a long story short after a few we will place phone call dodge approve a rental car for me at their expense since that ti ame the back door ha develop a leak that the service people can not seem to stop and just this afternoon this vehicle leave me strange the power sneer ha go out and it be sit in a park lot wait for a tow truck in the morning there have be other problem along the way with the electrical system and seatbelt that have to be replace i think i must have get the one vehicle that ha a little bite of all type of problem needle to say when this lease be up while i will still consider a dodge i will also be look at other manufacturer s model too
449;Auto;pro space and convenience excellent space usage and beat all the competition in adjust seat and the fold back seat be a dream come true ride for be one of the large van in it be class it candle very we will son too many annoy stitch recall have have recall on the automatic door something about the possibility of it open by it itself while you be drive never happen to me though dashboard light all light turn off one fine day they would have a recall late some recall in the exhaust system where they have to drill a hole in a pipe to avoid ice deposit in winter one additional one that i can not remember recently my check engine light ha be on and i have be to the leadership once and they could find out why few hour after they turn it off it be on again i will keep you update on how i make out beware of the side view mirror extremely fragile and replacement be expensive my neighbor kid press on the mirror and it pop off what be bad be that the replacement cost me 130 for part labor the central pilot snap off and one ha to get the complete unit include the power motor and cause replace i be try to talk to hand about it but unless a lot of customer complain i think i be gutta luck just be careful about them another friend of mine knock it off his garage door and he pay a total of 175 automatic slide door doe not stop beyond a certain point if you place your hand or another object typically if it be le than 12 24 inch from reach the end of the open remote to clock doe not always work a advertise double click to clock often doe not work and one ha to click multiple ti jam on the remote i think it wa my problem but the guy at the leadership have the same issue
450;Camera;my plant recently settle on the sonya fd92 digital camera for our plant to use although against my good judgement it turn out to be an okay purchase whereas it doe not meet my own standard it doe just fine for what it be need for they want the one with the floppy disk i have to get a new camera for my job of course they put me in charge of choose the right one i settle on the today dc4800 this wa a 3 1 megapixel camera with a lot of optical and digital room it have a 16 mb memory and have a number of option of conductivity aerial u etc it wa truly first class the cadillac escapade of digital camera but my co worker do not want that one they want the sonya fd92 only because it ha floppy disk it doe not come close to have the resolution that the dc4800 ha it only ha 1 5 mb it it be significantly large and heavy than the dc4800 this wa definitely not in the same class it wa a hand cry of digital camera make due so i have to suck it up and go with the compromise but this camera ha be okay it take surprisingly sharp photo of high quality it ha a really good optical room feature a we will i wa able to take a clear photo of one of our pump from 40 foot above this be i important when document damage in any of our industrial equipment crack lead misalignment etc i still hold that the dc4800 be a good camera but the sonya ha be no slough b great feature the sonya be relatively easy to use it ha a si ample interface and be easy to navigable you just switch between still mode for take picture and play mode for view your photo there be also a record mode for short and i mean short move but i do not use that much there be a couple of other nice feature like be able to include the ti ame on the photo this be good for document our photo what be probably the best feature be the ability to switch between resolution this will allow you to good manage your disk memory a we will a take the sharp photo when you need them b the flop be not that great although many people find them very convenient i find that the floppy disk add an element of uncertain not in take photo most prominently floppy disk break very easily i would hate to have a disk break on me before i wa able to download it onto my computer furthermore flop be slow to access than a build in memory they also make the camera that much heavy and expensive the camera doe come with a memory stick option but for additional money an 8 mb memory stick would be really helpful i think it just doe not fit into our budget for this camera could have get a cheap camera if all we we be go to get wa a 1 5 mb digital camera we could have spend half the money the sonya fd92 cost u 579 the dc800 wa 599 the extra 20 would have give u a technically superior camera the main cost factor for the sonya be the floppy drive but a i state before i do not see much of a benefit you still have to use a computer to process you photo why would you spend twice a much money just because you be uncomfortable use a u cable doe not make much sense to me but all thing come out we will in the end do not they
451;Camera;the full wa purchase for an expensive way of publish picture for bay auction it wa purchase on bay from a dealer for a good price the unit be nothing fancy but for the money ha perform very we will with li unite memory mb it can hold about 6 picture which be adequate for it be intend purpose to use personally i d want a mind alum of mb the unit produce 1024x768 i damage which be adequate for on line use for good photography a high resolution would be desirable the unit be small and easy to use it have a manual mode with white balance which allow good color correction for indoor light a with many digital camera have a supply of battery available a good alternative would be rechargeable alkaline or nice battery for continue use the only problem note be that many bay picture need to be shoot in the range between micro and regular so a couple picture be require to decide which be best at the 18 quit distance if use the camera for close or far photography it work extremely we will br br
452;Auto;i own a nissan sentry for almost five year before we purchase our quest i never have any trouble with it at all needle to say i felt i should be loyal to nissan a far a i be concern certain other car manufacturer owe me a car for the trouble i ve go through with them but my brother be a car salesman so i have to check out the dodge too the nissan wa 3 000 00 le with more feature like the rear audit something the dodge doe not have at this point also i wa trade in the nissan sentry so dodge offer me 1 500 00 for it nissan give me 3 400 00 for the nissan sentry that be quite a difference i know that the dodge be a bite big but i think those few cubic foot be not worth the price difference not to mention the peace of mind that i have with a nissan the to v unit that come with the vehicle be wonderful for my two kiss and we have take three long car trip since we purchase it in may the seat rearrange easily although it would be nice if the rear seat would come out completely this be a wonderful vehicle for any type of family it be room quiet and the ride be smooth br br
453;Camera;i wa very keen to get into the world of digital photography but this camera nearly turn me away from it for good i bring the my 1200 a part of a deal with my new printer the annoy little sale man assure me it wa a top little camera and that i would be very happy with it why do i listen to that stupid little man the my 1200 be not a good buy despite it be low price tag sure it doe have a few good point but my personal opinion be that you should save for a couple more month and by something where the pro outweigh the son i must admit that this be a very tempt price hey i buy it and there be some situation where this camera might be the ideal purchase for example if you only want a camera to use around the home then the my 1200 might just do the job but if your think of take it out into the field or on holiday then look elsewhere this camera ha a painfully short battery life so if you plan on be to far from the near power outlet be prepare to spend a fortune on battery turn off the lead screen will help to conserve power but then what be the point the package software be just plain awful it ha mind anal feature and take forever to load anything so you may want to have a separate program like photoshop the other disappoint feature be the room you can choose between normal or ridiculously close other letdown include the small medium card most shoot come out blur no u and there seem to be a high error or failure rate with the unload one thing worth mention if your plant on get the my 1200 be that the only way to get really crisp picture be to leave the flash on for every shoot i do not know why but it just work so here be the deal if your look for a first camera then this might be okay depend on what you want to do with it but i do warn you that it might just a easily put you off the world of digital photography for good
454;Auto;i own a 1999 model and it ha be in for constant repair it ha a very stiff ride very uncomfortable candle so so and ha terrible quality control problem mine ha be in for numerous electrical problem door open on their own fail electronic door lock window d change replace 3 ti jam etc the and shift lever vibrate so loud when accelerate that you can not hear the radio over it i have have it back to the leadership 3 ti jam and they refuse to do anything about it you also have to change the transmission fluid every 18 000 mile which be stupid the engine be sluggish and the transmission be fear too high the only good thing about this vehicle be the rake have last a long ti ame in my opinion the tooth 4 runner and ford explorer be a much good fig this be the same vehicle a the isuzu ride and the hand dealer do not like work on them
455;Camera;i purchase my polypus d 340 r about 6 month ago it wa my first digital camera purchase and i do a lot of research before i buy it the polypus seem to offer the best feature for the price i do not want rock bottom low quality cheap but i also do not want to spend thousand of dollar for a top of the line digital camera i have be very please with the polypus it offer good resolution a good amount of memory use the low resolution the camera can store about 120 picture i have order x print of picture take at this resolution and they look pretty good if you want good quality picture the polypus d 340 r can store 36 picture at a ti ame the d 340 r also come with plenty of little bell and whistle a ti ame a set to take rapid multiple picture a set for close up picture and lot of different view of your store picture on the lead screen i have 2 complex not about the camera the first be that the lead screen offer no menu system and navigation around it can be confuse and i often find myself have to start over while try to view room in on my store picture the second complex not be that use the lead screen really eat away at your battery life but this be easy enough to work around mind amie your use of the lead screen and always be sure to carry extra battery or invest in rechargeables br br
456;Camera;before i say a thing i must thank my dad for get me this sweet camera for my b day last year it be the best thing that ha ever happen to me yet it ha one major problem to start off the canon powershoot be one of the cool thing ever it be small unable and the picture be crisp and clear once you put them onto your computer let me just say that if your look to take pick that you will want to have physically to show your friend this be not the camera for you if you want to make a handy look web site or e mail your pick to fellow friend this be the camera for you the powershoot a many many many high ten feature that i will not get into this very moment the camera ha about four set and they all take brilliant photo what i love about this camera be that you can actually see the picture a soon a you take it and if you would not like it than you can i immediately delete it and start over the camera also ha a great panorama feature where you cannonade two picture side by side then patch them together for a panorama wide sense view awesom the problem with the camera be 1 you have to load up on assecories since you be not supply with them when you first by the camera it come with one 8 megabit chip that can hold about ten picture at one ti ame no case no strap and no rechargable battery or battery charge just one battery that go out very quickly so these assecories add up to about 500 dollar extra that be right i pay about this much for a matter charge 2 rechargable battery a case and a new 42 meg memory card that hold about 100 exposure aside from this set back another good quality about this camera be that it cannonade picture in various size shape and even color s yep that be right you have the option of take your picture in a black and white color cool hut and when they be load into your computer it look a if they be take from the old day cool a flash be build into this camera along with an amaze digital room i think it be an x digital room but i be no positively sure maybe it be 4 but anyway i wa at a baseball game take picture and the digital room can get so close that it take perfect action shoot of all of my favorite ball player i love it this little camera ha so much to offer about 50 thing on top of the one i just talk about this camera really be worth the money you will not be disappoint at all if you get one digital camera this year defiantly make this the one i will not let you wouldn br br
457;Camera;ve ha always have a good reputation for quality but maybe this be their first digital camera i ve own the camera for only one month but i have spend twice a much ti ame read the manual a use the camera the camera be much too complicate for the average user to learn how to use all it be function would take me at least 6 month of full ti ame choose the design be si amply overall far to complicate for the everyday user instruction manual be very poor in some case totally ambiguous and unfathomable also the control be poorly design the so call power dial which be the main control be cumbersome and poorly design the power dial the room control the mode control be be locate so close together that it be very difficult to avoid change the mode or twitch the power dial to another function ease photo from the smart medium card be very cumbersome and if you happen to let the card get full it become virtually i impossible the film copy mode for shoot negative or side be very poorly explain in the manual and even when you understand how to do it the challenge be considerable and the result be poor have two lead panel one on the back and one on the top of the camera be a pain also many function be much too slow also outdoor daylight it be almost i impossible to determine whether the picture ha be take or not if there be a be i ve never hear it yet the flash be annoy because it be on by default and you have to turn it off before take each picture a royal his that be it be an attractive look camera but let s be realistic function be beauty in term of function this camera be very ugly if you ask about shutter law who know you never when when the camera ha take the picture also photo quality be not nearly a good a my canon powershot and which ha only 2 1 meg this camera be best for professional because the average person will go crazy try to learn how to use it and put up with it be deficiency
458;Camera;i purchase my toshiba per m 25 mainly because of the feature for the price i want an optical room and a high enough resolution picture to print we will the toshiba seem to fit the bill the camera take good outdoor photograph with bright vagrant accurate color reproduction there be a problem however with the law between snap the picture and when the picture be record i have get several shoot where the people i wa photographic saw me snap the shoot so they move the photo i get wa of them move not the pose shoot i intend to get this be also a problem when try to take a shoot of a move object such a one of the deer that room our neighborhood low light photo come out grain like use a film camera in low light when the flash doe not fire even with the flash on you must be close to the subject to take an indoor or outdoor even picture in toshiba s defense they state that the flash be for picture up to 8 2 foot away from read review on several other digital camera i think this must be a common complex not i have read several complex not about short battery life and i will agree with some clarification when use the camera indoors and review the picture on the lead screen i have have the battery last only 10 or 12 picture conversely when take picture outside i have take in excess of 40 picture on 1 set of alkaline battery i have read where rechargeable ni be will last much long than this i have order some so i will soon know the camera seem to be more sensitive to movement than my mmm union probably because of shutter speed know what i do now i would check out some of the other camera a little close before i purchase this one again it may be that the short come of this camera be typical of digital camera in this price range

465;Camera;this be my first review so if i ve miss anything out please do not he imitate to leave a comment i ll try to answer any question i wa look for review on the polypus you 300 digital camera and find none so think i d set the ball roll so here go n b i live in the up so some aspect of this review might not apply but i ll try to keep it a product relate a possible i have decide to buy a digital camera because i be move to france for a year and want to record my experience there i start off by just browse the different camera in my price range around 300 480 i wa i immediately draw to the you 300 because it look so sleek and attractively design especially compare to some of the union which we be far bulky have stop around i finally pay 243 include a 10 student discount u 390 to be honest i wa more in the market for a point and shoot camera than anything particularly professional but i do some research to make sure i wa get the best speck for my money i wa particularly i impress by the room quality the movie mode and the generally sharp clear picture it give me when i wa try it out and my opinion ha not change in the week i have have the camera i buy an upgrade for the picture card and can now store 160 picture on the camera at a ti ame which be plenty for me i do not feel the limb card wa enough i find set up the camera si ample to say the least and the battery only take 2 hour to fully charge from new they even include a continental adapt so i can use it easily in france we have different electricity plug here how convenient have take my picture i then set up the software on my computer many of my friend have have problem transfer their photo from their camera to the pp but the software provide wa excellent si ample easy to use and yet still powerful i have a yet have no problem transfer edit print i damage it be wise to read the manual properly first a polypus use symbol for different function and command so it be a bite confuse if you would not learn what they mean first you get the hang of it really quickly however and after that it be no problem my one complex not would be that there wa no case provide and i have have difficulty find one to fit you need something to protect the screen from scratch and surely it would not cost much to provide a basic cheap pouch especially a they even go to the trouble of provide 24 month free cover with www yellow com the camera it itself however ha be wonderful it look great be easy to use and take excellent photo i would recommend without he imitation
466;Camera;digital camera have come a long way since i get my first one in 1992 back then they we be black and white grayscale in computer term but black and white in photographic term have poor resolution we be expensive we be slow and transfer i damage to a pp wa an ordeal this camera show just how far the medium ha come in a bite over a decade the visioneer mx200 be an entry level digital camera while it lack the feature find in more expensive camera it still boat a 2 megapixel resolution which be sufficient to produce clear sharp picture up to 8 by 10 inch it import an lead display which be de river for digital camera these day it ha mb of internal memory which in theory can hold up to 66 picture in normal resolution however in super resolution it can hold seven there be also three intermediate resolution with intermediate capacity super resolution can be think of a normal resolution compare to the good digital camera on the market so if you want clear sharp print that can survive drop or enlarge to 8 by 10 then you good stick to the maxim alum resolution which be 2048 1536 although the memory issue seem like a li agitation the camera support smartmedia card a 128mb card cost me 39 with a 10 debate 29 net and that bring the capacity up to 145 super resolution picture if you want more capacity you can buy several card use low resolution or just unload the picture to your computer more frequently if you be satisfy with 4 by 6 snapshot or plan to use the camera for web photo only then the internal memory at normal resolution should be adequate and a si similar smartmedia card can give you about 900 photo the camera come with a build in flash set for white balance and flash include an automatic one for each a micro set and a set for portrait landscape and night scene a we will a a self ti ame the camera can also be use in pp mode a a pp camera with application such a microsoft netmeeting the camera can record video clip up to one minute long albeit without sound there be also a 3 1 digital room a with many digital camera a digital room be a poor substitute for an optical one i read elsewhere that since the number of pipe in the cod be fix the camera must make use of an algorithm to map loom pipe onto the cod and unless the room amount be an even multiple you end up lose quality likewise if you wouldecide to just crop the picture late you will lose quality since edit a peg and save it a a peg cause loss of resolution needle to say you can not find analogy room on any camera in this price range a of this write however i do find that photo take without the room appear to be of good quality the camera come with a case strap u cable video cable for to hook software instruction and dead battery customer support acknowledge that many user report that the battery we be dead after only two or three picture mine do not last so long and the camera tell me to change my battery before i take a single picture accord to the documentation the camera should be use with alkaline battery only in another area it say that it come with alkaline or ni be battery it come with alkaline in yet another section it state that alkaline or ni be battery should be use alkaline battery be not very useful in this camera if you use them you will need to keep the lead screen off and you will run out of battery after a dozen picture or so if you leave the camera on by mistake it happen to me once when the button get push even though it wa in the case then you might get only two picture from a set of alkaline battery i buy a set of ni be battery and a charge for 5 99 and the camera ha be do fine ever since the battery life rat i give refer to the battery supply or any a alkaline battery use to replace them if you try to take flash picture with alkaline battery be prepare to turn the camera off afterwards to let the battery rest before you can use it axis note camera accept an ac adapt but there be no mention of it in the documentation the visioneer webster mention that you can use a iv 1000ma convert it doe not say the plug size or that it need to be a convert with do output however once the support person give me the model number of an adapt from radio shock that work i wa able to find out most of what i need to know such adapt come with multiple plug or entitle the user to a plug that fit the unit in the case of radio shock other part relate to the functionality of the camera be lack in the documentation for example the explanation of the status lead say that you cannonade a picture when it be a solid green but you must wait when it be blink however it doe not say why the camera doe not work when the lead be amber i will update this section if i ever find that out the documentation say that the camera feature advance sleepless digital room superior add but there be no explanation of what add tm be the instruction for the present mode neglect to tell you how to get to them you must first set the dial to pre set this may be obvious when you have the camera and be use to it but if you read the manual ahead of ti ame or without the camera in front of you it make no sense the troubleshoot section of the documentation be far from comprehensive and if you have enough navvy to know how to check the battery there be a battery level indicator on the screen but it be obviously useless if your battery be completely dead turn the unit off and make sure that the memory card be in correctly it be of little use customer support be fair there be an on line web base system that tell you much of what be leave out of the manual but not nearly enough when i speak to the customer support folk they we be not able to tell me much beyond what be available on line what they would tell me in some case if accurate do not install confidence in the case of the ac adapt i wa tell that all they know be what wa in their database and it come from a customer who try it and it work when i tell them that what the webster say wa inadequate they would not seem concern with date it when it come to get photo to your computer the task be painless if you load the driver from the d then window will detect the camera a it doe with any plug and play device the camera will then appear a an external drive and you can copy picture use standard window tool i do not test this with a mac but it should work the camera will organize photo in holder by date there will be a subdirectory for each date on which photo we be take and photo within the directory will have a name compose of the date and a aerial number 07280001 pg would be the first photo take on 7 with the camera also come with digital camera utility software that allow you to select and download photo however the software be not rich enough in feature to warrant any sort of praise nor do i feel that i really need it if you already have software for view and edit i damage it be not an issue when i get my first digital camera i wa beta test it for logitech it wa the first consumer torment digital camera on the market it lack feature and could not handle many contrast situation for example photographic african american wa not possible if you want facial feature to be discernible by contrast in high resolution this camera will produce i damage and print up to 8 by 10 inch that rival that of a good but not professional quality 35 mm camera that be assume that you would not room and you compose the picture properly and use the proper set however the default set will work a we will a one would would expect from many camera with automatic set and the lead display will give you an idea of what to expect if you use other set the bottom line be that it be a cheap camera that take good picture in the camera s most basic mode it will not compare in quality to a high end digital camera but if you be use to an expensive mmm camera and wish to go digital this should be more than adequate be prepare to spend a bite more on memory 30 50 battery and charge 6 30 and an ac adapt 12 20 multi lately if you want the convenience of long usage the ability to leave it plug into your pp and the ability to store more photo the price can easily double so check out whether more expensive model come with these feature a standard before you wouldecide if this be the camera for you that be especially true if you may need to buy an aftermarket i damage edit tool that may come for free with a more expensive camera
467;Camera;this must be the bad full size digital camera i have ever have it be bulky size and weight make it nearly i impossible to carry with you if you be however brave enough to attempt it i strongly recommend purchase a reinforce carry case a i have have the experience with grip strap on case form this camera the 1 9 megapixels in this camera look like 0 9 in another the photo will look excellent on the lead screen but when transfer to a pp or print the poor quality of the lens become evident the fact that the memory card can not be remove be bind to say the least you be li unite to a certain number of photo you cannonade and if you be not anywhere near a pp where you can download your picture and get them off the camera s memory card you be out of luck it be like have a camera with a roll of film stick in it the workmanship of the camera leaf much to be desire a we will i have to replace the battery once this thing go through battery like you would not believe i and the slide that keep the battery in the camera break it will no long close i ve resort to put a rubber band on the camera to keep it work

477;Auto;i buy my new 04 special edition deep grand cherokee only about 2 week ago and have only 1000 mile on it iso far everything be great and i look forward to drive it every day the special edition offer a nice try be package with color side hold no plastic on the outside a good sterno fog light and an upper console information system gas mileage temperature compass etc i live in atlanta so i often for the six cylinder engine with two wheel drive i be no speed demon and i do not intend on get my new deep dirty by go off road i love the way the cherokee candle on the road it be tight and very responsive the engine be very quiet along with the overall ride of the deep i wa very i impress by the low wind noise i wa expect to get on my first test drive all the control be at easy reach and easy to read and operate i like the delay feature on the rear window wipe my last sun only have on and off the sterno ha an amaze sound that fill up the cabin with extreme clarity it make my drive ti ame more enjoyable the cherokee ha plenty of storage compartment to offer and i especially like that they put the full size spare tire on the inside of the vehicle so in case of a flat you be not outside try to down feel a dirty tire from underneath both the rear watch and glass open separately which can be a bless when haul large item one thing i do not care for be the way you have to pull up the back seat in order to fold down the back rest so it lay flat you have to take the headdress off find a place to put them for a moment pull up the seat cushion pull down the back rest and then place the headdress in their small shoot to be store deep could have take a lesson from some of the other domestic engineer and figure a way to pull one lever and have everything move forward and lay flat in one motion the only other complex not i have be where the window and door lock control be place on the door panel i felt it would be easy if they could place them far toward the dash so it would be easy to operate other than the two complex not i have list above i can not find anything i do not like about my new deep the gas mileage wa a bite good then what i expect so i really do not have any complex not in that area this be an sun so if gas consumption be an issue for you would not buy any sun like i say i be very i impress with the mileage i be receive so far a you cannotell by now i be no serious review writer but i cannotell you that i be very happy with my new deep i hope to get many year of enjoyment out of it
478;Camera;i love almost everything about this camera i have own mine for over one year and i have few complex not and high praise let me start by say that i rate and have expectation from the camera relative to what be it mean i would not buy a go retro and expect a bow that be say for a 1 5 meg fix camera i find the picture quality excellent i have reproduce many of the photo on print i have take through my local printshop the print quality of the digital photo print rival most non digital print i wa able to compare at the shop on many occasion there be enough feature in the camera to allow you to customize your photo and picture take style you will not feel a if you be si amply at the mercy of the camera the auto shutter feature be a great way to capture action shoot where you can not si amply say ok hold it right there you can activate the slow shutter mode with or without the use of the flash to create cool effect such a motion slur the x optical room give a feel of a conventional camera and be very useful while many camera have high level digital room you will often find the you wind up see what the camera think the distant object look like through the use of refine digital interposition some jam it be good some jam not an optical room be just that optical through the lens not electronics although only x you will find it a true representation of the object photographer the micro feature on the camera will let you focus down to a few cm of an object use the micro you can photograph thing a fine a the fine print of a newspaper with ease the digital lead screen be a perfect size and high resolution but you will find it be nearly useless in bright sunlight in these case use the build in viewfinder will yield equally good photo the control be locate perfectly however some button be a bite small and you might find it easy to fat finger a button from ti ame to ti ame all silver cloud have dark line or be that the other way around anyway there be a few downfall the auto ti ame on the camera doe not allow you to modify the same set that you can when you be take picture normally i have find this a minor problem and have take some of the best remote photo in my life with this camera if you have a very sharp eye you will notice that photo tend to have a slight fish perspective if you we be to take a photo of an object with perfectly straight parallel line from top to bottom at the furthest edge of the useful display you will note that the line curve outward slightly in the middle and inward at the top and bottom like i say unless you have a sharp eye and be look for it you may never notice it i use my camera for business and often have to take picture of telecommunication equipment rank which be pretty straight this camera eat power the battery take some ti ame to charge and ha little to show for it when it be charge a second battery might be need to get the most flexibility out of the camera i find that i try to use the lead screen only to view photo and not to take them this greatly add to battery life the aerial interface should be a last resort unless you like long wait this really ha nothing to do with full or the camera it really come down to the speed of the aerial bus in today s computer i would suggest an aftermarket smartmedia reader either floppy or u base i personal own a scandisk u smartmedia reader which allow instant access to my photo without kill the camera battery in the process last but not least do not drop it no bid right after all it be a camera the die cast she will might give you the false sense of disability but believe me the inside of this camera be pack tightly drop or hard shock will damage it easily other then that this camera be a dream i would recommend it to anyone at the same ti ame i would recommend four other option external smartmedia reader speed thing up and save battery power extra smart medium of 16 or 32 meg the 8 meg smart card be just too small and will only allow for about 14 16 hi yes picture extra battery because when the battery dy and you be away from home or the hotel you be out of luck try great for ti amid shoot or when you use the slow shutter set unless you can hold yourself robotic like still
479;Camera;great one word i use to have the mavra ff 73 until it wa quit misplace quit at a car show i operate a very graphic intensive webster that require frequent update of picture and i damage every since lose my ff 73 i have be look for a replacement i want something with superb room yet easy to use and transfer picture to my computer although this unit wa much big than it be competitor the feature more than make it up for it since most of my i damage end up on the web at 300x400 i wa not too concern with the megapixel rate nor the quality my main goal wa to have a camera that can room i use it mainly at car show and event where i can not get too close to the performer or entertain with this incredible six room i be able to take quality picture without have to dig my way through a crowd i use to prefer to use my canon rebel 2000 over the ff 73 because my picture turn out good when use a view finder i do not like to have to rely on the lead screen to frame my shoot but the trouble with take real picture be the after process of develop scan and reside one of the main sell point of the ff 95 be it be view finder which evidently ha a quit eye sense quit feature to avoid battery oris note main reason sonya magical be such hot seller be because that they take floppy disk over smart medium or card floppy disk be cheap the ff 95 allow me to record in 640x480 and up to 1600x1200 resolution so no matter what resolution i decide to use i can always have a smash of flop in my bag to store them in at 640x480 i can get a many a 35 picture on to one floppy i elect to buy the limb memory stick with floppy adapt which could store 5 600 picture at one ti ame i still carry at least 5 flop with me in case someone with me want a copy of the picture i be take share picture with 25 flop be much cheap than let friend borrow your memory card then worry when they will return it the battery that come with the ff 95 last about 2 230 i damage on average this camera doe not come with a charge instead you get a cable that attach directly onto the camera therefore you can actually use the camera while it be charge i ve also get the extend sonya infolithium battery which allow for 3 350 picture per charge a good investment if you take a lot of picture while travel the camera also come with a hot shoe but unfortunately you have to use the sonya external flash i think that any flash would work with it since the internal flash be often insufficient for take picture in poorly light area such a car show build and night club most people who see my camera complain about the size yes it be quite a large camera compare to most digital available i personally prefer large camera a they feel more comfortable in my hand a big guy hold a tiny little camera look funny to me i ve always have the perception that big camera make the photographer look professional ll if you can get past the size and a little bite slow in i damage record ti ame then this be the camera for you i take an average of 4 500 picture per event i attend so i be use to carry a bag anyway now instead of roll of film i have a surplus of flop and a matter or two

skateboarder and both music fan the i damage traditional victoria mansion with christmas light 147woodpushers 148 and multi pierce both we be all very we will expose with accurate color and no detestable noise we get together again on sunday morning to try some outdoor daylight shoot the weather wa much good sunny and blue sky with patch white cloud but very cold mid 20 146s we bundle up and drive across the river to the fall of the ohio state park just over the ohio river in clarksville indiana the park be the only place where you can actually see the 380 million year old devotion fossil bed the expose remain of an ancient reef the reef use to form a short drop fall that i impede navigation on the ohio river it wa necessary to pull boat out of the river above the fall and 147portage 148 them and their cargo to a site below the fall where they could be put back in the water the 147portage 148 make the area the perfect site for a town general george rogers clark build a fort on sand island to protect kentucky then a county in virginia and control river traffic that peri active little fort eventually become the city of louisville next year the fall of the ohio will be a local point for the three year lewis and clark centennial the expedition to explore the louisiana purchase commence it be journey to the pacific from the fall of the ohio river captain lewis join co captain clark the young brother of louisville 146s founder george rogers clark here most of the corp of discovery party that accompany lewis and clark to the pacific we be from louisville kentucky and jeffersonville indiana neither of u have be to the fall since mid summer we wander around for a couple of hour take photo with the c 5050 and freeze our butt off photography at the fall be much easy in the summer when the area be fill with an explosion of green grow thing hundred of bird dog kiss hers and fisherman picture opportunity be much hard to find in early winter we would get some nice shoot of the louisville skyline from the fossil bed and we get a couple of good i damage of the fossil bed with some neat oblique afternoon light the fall of the ohio state park be locate at exit 0 on interstate 65 north the c 5050 do just a we will in bright daylight a it have do in the dark the of assist light work beautifully long exposure be a snap no put intend and shutter law shoot to shoot ti jam and write to card ti jam especially if you use an d picture card be very quick b i damage quality the c 5050 146s i damage quality be exceptional easily a good or good than any five megapixel digital camera currently available skin tone and color be the most accurate i have see to date and that ha a lot to do with polypus 146 excellent i damage interposition all digital camera use interposition to balance color and contrast polypus design the c 5050 146s interposition software to produce more accurate color and good contrast my friend and i print two 8x10 inch enlargement from full size peg file on an elson status photo epx785 and they we be both excellent even when inspect with a x mamma lope we also print up a couple of shoot from the fall at x and both we be very good with accurate we will saturate color excellent contrast and tack sharp resolution very i impressive performance for the cheap five megapixel digital camera currently available b a few concern the c 5050 146s optical viewfinder be a little tight small and you have to square your nose against the lead to use it polypus could have do a good job here the c 5050 ha a really aggressive sharpen function at the default set i damage tend to be hard edge and a little over sharp expert agent with the minus set until you find the level that work best for you minus sharpen will also low noise level at the iso 100 set there be barely visible barrel distortion at the wide angle end of the c 5050 146s room range but pincushion distortion at the telephone end of the room appear to be very we will control chromatic aberration be visible at the maxim alum aperture in high contrast scene but can be easily control by use the histogram display to adjust contrast level or shoot at ff conclusion polypus be offer the c 5050 at a low price than compete five megapixel digital camera and that will oblige the other major manufacturer to i improve their exist technology and offer new model that provide i approve performance and incorporate prove component rather than introduce new technology competition always benefit consumer because new technology be very very expensive to develop and consumer must pay the research and development cost in addition new technology always come with bag and first generation of consumer must act a the final stage of research and development at their own expense if your digital camera be more than one year old then there be many reason for upbraid there have be many significant i improvement include high resolution and new camera be much fast lead screen be sharp and bright and not a jerky color be true and white balance be much i approve digital camera price be the low they have ever be the camelia c 5050 be target toward advance amateur and casual pro user who want manual control and advance feature i damage from the c5050 be a good or good than the i damage from any 5 megapixel digital camera i have use and in the final analysis i damage quality really be 147job one 148 everything else be just iting on the cake to put a bite more of an emphasis on that statement the c 5050 represent a real advance in the digital i amaze evolution with the fat lens f 1 8 of any currently available digital camera very good low light performance lot of user input an almost infinite variety of i damage adjustment option and lot of serious i damage enhance feature the c 5050 be worthy of serious consideration from anyone look for a pro quality five megapixel i amaze tool at a presume dig can price
482;Camera;i buy it a my first digital camera and wa satisfy totally the look wa great the lead screen size be ample the only con be that the battery drain out too soon so have a back set of charge able battery a a first ti ame buyer of a digital camera i do not know anything about digital camera when i wa look for a digital camera my brother suggest to buy a camera with pipe between 2 and 3 meg pipe it seem that camera with 1 3 meg pipe be the standard for the most of digital camera in the market however the quality of a picture take by a 1 3 meg fix camera seem slightly le than a normal picture take by a non digital camera so how good be 2 1 meg pipe the real quality of pipe can be test when a picture be enlarge i wa just amaze to see how much a 2 1 meg fix digital picture can be enlarge without lose it be clearness a 8 x blow up can be print with great result when click at best resolution and quality you need to try it the camera also come with a 8 mb memory card and 2 x digital room i buy a 64 mb card for cheap and this store a many photo a 600 photo at 600x480 resolution and 125 photo at the max resolution of 2 1 meg fix a be the case for other digital camera the data can be easily send by e mail to a friend or can be print by a high level color picture printer the include software and the u s b link up make unload photo to your computer a breeze the software make a virtual drive for the camera and can use the window explorer to download picture there be a good i damage edit and album software include the quality of the picture print by those high quality printer be not different or good from a picture take by a non digital camera also if a picture do not turn out a you intend the picture can be erase i immediately without get print consider it be price le than 150 fine six 2300 offer the best value for a digital camera with over 2 meg pipe in summary just beware of the lack of optical room and bad battery life

484;Camera;i start look for a digital camera early this summer and after look at several in the store and read several opinion i choose the canon powershot s high rate on opinion which i use for all of my shop information on what and more i importantly where to buy it wa a great choice in the last 6 most i have take over 200 great picture which more than i take over the last 10 year before i have the canon powershot s this camera be lightweight small and easy to use it be even semi water resistant a few weekend ago on a camp trip i fell into the river in the excitement of my boyfriend catch a huge fish and the camera somehow survive be fully submerge into the water it still work perfectly and i even manage to savage the picture i have take before the face plant the only piece of criticism i have for this camera be that the battery life be very short always have a few charge back battery on hand when you take this camera out otherwise it be a great investment and i concur with everyone else on opinion who ha recommend it a a great purchase i buy mine on buy com for about 400 but i be sure you can get it cheap now opinion will show you where to get the best deal

487;Camera;we will power someone ha write almost exactly the review i would have i absolutely love the 780c i have not buy any of the extra like rechargeable battery or an adapt card yet a friend who cell digital camera kind of coffee at me want to purchase this camera until he saw the quality of a picture take i rarely even use the high resolution and get some of the most detail clear picture much good than even my mmm camera i find it very easy to use and once you get the hang of the photo program it be a inch occasionally i find that i need to go in and fix up a picture usually to make it a bite light i have poor light in my house but the result when you would that be even good only take some of the sharpness out of the picture i really would recommend someone buy this camera my mon love receive picture i have print on photo paper in the snail mail and i love not have to pay for the develop only to get a few good shoot my husband love that he can delete a photo that do not come out right here br br
488;Auto;the s2000 it be flash and it be fast but it be never really fit into any category if you be look for something fast and powerful you look towards porch and audit if you want a family car you head towards hand and vulvo i would have think that hand s change for the good would have form the s2000 into a more economy type car instead they have take all the practability out of it gaze up it be look and make it a lot more fun i test drive the s2000 at my local dealer although i never really consider purchase i wa definitely i impress it wa light and fast and it seem a though the handle fit like a glove i wa make turn at 45 without a bite of he imitation and you could really feel the strength that go through the hand it doe have a few problem though and actually hand ha make it a bite awkward to drive the console this be a quite i important piece of the car a it tell you some information vital to drive a car hand take it and turn it into a video game they be seem to be chart and graph and feature and whatever else they could think of to make it look good it hurt your head just look at it i have hear that a lot of the more recent release we be equip with standard console and if you find one like that it be donna be a lot more easy on you than the one i test drive now for the family man this be a nice look car but merely a toy there be no possible way you could use this for a family a it ha only two seat due and basically no storage room i mean none the trunk be small and i be really not even sure if it fit a spare tire even the glove compartment ha be drunken down a it now fold out vertically although it look like everything would fall out of it it doe work alright yet i d definitely rather have a standard glove compartment just like the console this be one of hand s other fun little gizmo gas mileage be not that bad for a family car but si amply rank up with other sport car the dealer say it could get 26 mile to the gallon but i d really say it be more like 22 if you want a practical car turn around right now the game s up on the s2000 price we will i be not really sure if it be good or bad since i do not know if i be judge a sport car or an economy car i ll just say that it cost about ask but the dealer be get up for ask if you get it through to them that you know how much their pay a lot of dealer will give you the car for ask and change for a sport car 33 thousand be not bad but it be no porch but the s2000 doe have 240 horse so i d say that for ask you be get a pretty good deal once again you be buy a toy this be the kind of decision you would really want to think over before plunge down the cash at the rate they be go right now in a year you should be able to get one use for 15 or ask then again it would be use my conclusion be good for this car if you want a sappy sport car with a fairly good price and mediocre gas mileage you have find your car it look good on the road for all you thick magnet and it come in quite a variety of color there be a new blue color but i still prefer the black you will be get a much good value if you can work your dealer down to ask and if you buy one now remember that it will probably have the video game console and the annoy glove compartment you could surely get those thing change but then you would be put more money down and once you be talk in the ask range the s2000 s si amply overprice look over the option before you buy and test drive if you test drive it first you might just si amply fall in love this be my first review so leave me a comment if you have any question about the review the car or anything in general feel free to contact me at pavshow all com thank you for read my first review a i be go to need encouragement to think it be actually good
489;Camera;the do room camera by today be definitely a professional camera and really give a professional performance but it be not for everyone the feature be i impressive but so be the price it ha a x optical room plus a x digital room for a local length equivalent to mmm wide angle to 115mm room it ha a 1 6 million fix resolution 1536 x 1024 and a 2 0 quit taft color lead for review and review plus an optical viewfinder there be four flash mode to choose from and an optional external flash son enable and it include the limb today picture card it be fully compatible with window 95 98 it 4 0 and power mackintosh face 7 6 or late it also ha automatic or manual exposure with automatic white balance this equipment really deliver but it be not for the his not hearted it be a 950 model fear towards someone that be very familiar with digital technology if you be a novice do not start here if not go for it you will be amaze with the quality br br
490;Auto;the chrysler corp seem to be struggle a bite it be not for a lack of good product certainly dodge trunk have fetch themselves on our collective consciousness a tough and unable alternative to they or ford and the dodge viper consistently make the top ten where performance be concern the deep liberty be a ten fold i improvement over the cherokee it replace but what about the sedan name like see status intrepid and concord do not seem to ring any bell with many consumer again not for a lack of good product those car be all fine choice but seem to suffer from an anonymity of sort a perfect case in point be the chrysler 300m typically chryslers have be more about luxury than performance the 300m seek to blend the two in keep with the heritage of chrysler s letter car of the wa and wa grant the number 300 use to be an indication of horsepower but ti jam change chrysler s late 300 the 300m be an attractive and we will balance performance sedan si similar in execution to an acute or infinity the problem with chrysler be that no acute or infinity customer seem to be cross shop the 300m with the in or to there be no good reason for this other than the fact that the name chrysler lack the name recognition or palace of an acute infinity or even plexus let face it when a consumer hear the name acute they be not confuse with think of minivan or mid price convertible the name acute mean a few specific thing luxury combine with performance and reliability chrysler should do the same give all the minivan and mid price sedan and convertible to dodge and let chrysler stand a a premium brand that balance performance and luxury global product strategy aside the 300m be quite a capable car it doe in fact blend performance and luxury and doe it very we will inside the 300m be nice little touch of class such a the white face gauge with come ring around them an analogy clock with the same come treatment and a beautiful wood an leather sneer wheel although the sneer wheel ha many cruise control button they would not light up at night force the driver to take his her eye off the road for just a second the instrument cluster grow in a backlit non bluish tint that feel both modern and retro at the same ti ame the luxury side of this car be obvious leather seat be soft but the leather lack the quality feel of a cadillac plexus or even a tooth two person memory set not only the seat but mirror and radio station a we will include the sneer wheel in the memory set would be even good rear seat leg room be excellent rival even the much large cadillac neville head room be also excellent coli mate control button be si ample straightforward and easy to reach audit control be a little more confuse and seem to lack the economic thoughtfulness find on many japanese car but an in dash d change be a welcome feature on any car overall the dash be we will lay out and convey a si ample elegance the main detractor inside the 300m be the verse of cheap look and feel plastic while much of the interior ha a quality feel much of the dash and console area seem cheap by comparison on the road the 300m life up to it be performance heritage with firm suspension and plenty of power sure a 300m should have 300 he but 250 be plenty the 300m be low by a 3 5 late ve and while 250 he be in fact plenty this car lack the all out grunt of the much more expensive cadillac seville it still acceleration be brisk and the engine ha a please growl even under hard stump on the gas the chrysler s ve also ha a sport exhaust note something that be noticeably lack on other sport luxury sedan such a the neville it plexus be and infinity in hard cover be nothing short of fun in the 300m and while it be easy to make horsepower comparison to cadillacs cost 10 20 000 more the 300m will out handle most any sedan with the possible exception of an audit or bow compare an audit to a chrysler surely the grumble ha begin but the 300m be not just an appearance package it be really a stiff and sport car when press hard the nose ha a tendency to push in the corner but such be the nature of front wheel drive car remember this be a car that can make spirit drive a blast but still carry 5 adult comfortably there be a slight price to pay for the 300m s agile cover ability on rough road the 300m s ride seem a bite harsh lack the softness of an acute or plexus however both acute and plexus sedan be prone to much more body roll than the 300 continue the sport theme be chrysler s autostick auto manual transmission this shift it yourself automatic be one of more responsive system of any car that be so equip with the possible exception of porch once the autostick mode ha be select the shift be precise and quick the shift lever it itself ha a quality feel with virtually no excess play right to leave the only drawback to the autostick be the clunkiness with which it side into the autostick gate there be a bite of a catch when go back and forth between full automatic and autostick that be slightly unerring to enter autostick mode the driver must shift into one extra notch below the d for drive then move the lever right or leave to move up or down a gear in other auto manual equip car such a the kit optic be the shift it yourself mode be enter by slide the shift to the right then move the lever up or down to select a high or low gear the type of system use in the kit be much more intuition this be a minor point at best and most driver will quickly adapt to the chrysler system with no complex not overall the 300m be an under appreciate sport sedan that be worth consider when shop for other sport sedan bow owner will likely not be sway but anyone consider a plexus january acute or infinity owe it to themselves to test drive a 300m the handle prowess will bring a smile to your face it be an incredibly tight car even though the interior be not up to plexus standard in term of quality and comfort it doe have an elegance that be lack in other american car even the neville s interior seem bland by comparison the 300m s few shortcoming can be boil down to just three 1 too much road noise 2 some cheap interior piece 3 no light on the sneer wheel mount control all tell the 300m be a good look room somewhat unfordable sport sedan that offer a lot of sport with a little luxury base price for the 300m be around 29 000 that doe not include such extra a a sunroof or come wheel the standard 300m be all you need to fulfill the sport urge but still rest note practically of an everyday car
491;Camera;i be what some would call a professional artist i ve work a a photographer a we will a a graphic artist because of this i like to think that i have a pretty good knowledge of what look good and i must tell you that you can get some great pick out of this little guy i say little in a figurative sense this camera be a have on the big heavy side i be use to full size work with mmm sir camera tar 120 camera and even x large format camera so i be not too pick when it come to lag a camera around the today dc240 be not cumbersome in any way it be si amply a little large than i would have hop there be small digital camera on the market but they would not yield the same i damage quality and feature so a slightly large size be an acceptable tradeoff for me next we come to the i damage size resolution offer i ve find that for the majority of my us the today ha actually give me more than i end up use on the average 600x450 be about the size i use when send picture to family and friend so 1280x960 be more than adequate it allow me to do something that you can not really do when li unite to 640x480 crop and scale with some room to breathe the optical room come in handy quite frequently and i find the option of 2 different light meet mode center weight and multi pattern to be quite generous white balance and exposure compensation round out the suite of photo option today go beyond this and include in camera effect which can be quite fun a we will a user desirable border this be especially useful when you be connect the camera through the include video adapt cable i wa extremely i impress with the quality of the video output from this little camera it can be useful for review the content of the memory card when a camera be not available i really like the driver software include with the camera it allow your camera to be see through window explorer a if it we be a hard drive or zip disk just no drive letter and enable you to si amply drag and drop the picture you want off of your camera i find the u connection speed to be just a little too slow though it be dramatically fast than some others i ve see now for the little thing that i be not totally happy with the camera offer decent battery life when the lead and flash be not be use though it can run through the battery before you even fill up your memory card with both enable i ve notice that the picture come out a little too saturate at ti jam and a little too bright at others so a little take with the photoshop be program of your choice may be in order to get the best result in general though the i damage do not need to be touch it be just a matter of personal preference today doe not seem to have include a method to rest the picture count the picture be name in sequence to my knowledge and i would really like to see some facility for that the only serious flaw i ve find in this camera be occasional lockup in the camera it itself i have not find any mention of this on the today webster and i have not see any firmware update to address the problem either regardless the problem be very infrequent all in all i d recommend the camera to anyone look to get into digital photography or just look for something with a quick cheap turnaround than a hour photolab this camera be perfect for family and small business office but nothing beyond that film be still the best way to go for real graphic work and i doubt that digital will be able to completely displace it for quite a while br br

494;Auto;i have just start a new job i be in sale and i need a car that would be reliable and something i could feel good about own my first new car wa a 1994 they cavalier which i never regret buy because of both it be appearance and performance i want to do the same with this car my wife s family swear by hand and i have always be i impress when i see old hand that still look sharp and not outdated hand also ha a good reputation for disability we originally we be look at hand civic to fit in with my newlywed new job budget however they we be try to unload the 2002 accord to get the 2003 s in read excuse to tell you that you be get a good price on the car so we go with the accord the reason that we choose the special edition wa because my wife really like the model it be a sharp look car we get the black couple without the flap spoil i be proud to own it from that standpoint and we would get a good deal the special edition give you aluminium ri a be be cassette d sterno w 6 speaker adjustable seat raise and low moon roof and cruise control performance ha give me mix feel i do drive the car clot 14 000 mile in 6 month it doe not have clot of power take off speed be often slow especially if the car hasn t have a chance to warm up go up hill be a big concern for me because i live in a hilly town i get stick on my first hill here in the winter i start from a dead stop on an upgrade and barely make it up i never have any problem like that before i never think i wa get a race car but i expect a little more than that the window fog at every give opportunity a we will what be even more strange be use the air condition over the theater get rid of it quick the sterno be top notch i wa ready to replace it right off the bat but it can be loud if you need it loud and the sound be good with the six speaker system another good feature be the inability to lock your key in the car if the key be in the munition and you hit lock on the car either by mentally press the lock stick down or the all lock button and you shut the door it will automatically clock overall the car be nice but i think i pay too much for it even at 18 000 the real test will be after i have hit 100 000 mile and what the car look like then
495;Auto;i ve now have my 2002 period for 15 000 mile and can bring to you a review with some experience behind it the pro the period be definitely expensive compare with other si similar car out there standard the period ha cruise control air condition power window power mirror adjustment in dash d player foglamp and a trunk organizer that be just fabulous i look at several other si similarly price feature model and find them to be underfeatured or overprice compare to the period every ti ame i wa particularly shock with the ford focus wagon which i felt wa a terrible value it rattle and creak while drive wa underpowered and poorly design and ford have few incentive to buy on the other hand the make protege 5 be a wonderful car with good feature but comparable equip it be much more expensive than the period i believe the period be a great value the period ha a lot of room and be a very easy car to live with the seat be comfortable in front and back and my basketball play 6 oft tall friend have commend it on the ample backseat leg and bedroom the rear seat both fold down for transport stuff and can be adjust back in three position from nearly erect to a slightly decline position for the comfort of your passenger the rear seat have a fold down arrest with a cup holder which my passenger like for storage the period ha a large glove compartment a drawer under the front passenger seat shallow door pocket in front three upholder in the console two in front one in back magazine pocket on the back of the front seat a pocket in the very back and one of my favorite feature a multi compartment storage area under the rear deck that include an integrate bucket you know all that stuff that seem to build up in your trunk you can store it in here make for a near car and keep it handy at the same ti ame with the seat fold down for show i have be surprise at what will fit in back i have fit a 32 to in box a full size whirlpool clothe dwyer not to mention several table and other stuff short of an sun or pick the period ha a lot of space for the price the period be an economical car to drive low by a 141 he 2 0 late online 4 the period get about 26 pg in the city and 33 pg on the highway i ve find that it be i important to keep an eye on the period s tire pressure or these number plume fast the period come back with an excellent warranty a we will and the success of the car ensure plentiful part for year to come the period be fun to drive i d describe the engine a puppy in that i leadfoot rarely feel like my need for speed be be deny when need extra juice for a high speed merge or pas a tramp on the gas be all it take and the period take off with plumb when the a c be run the pp be a little more restrain but not too much ride be good than i would expect from a car this economical but it be not perfect there be road tire and engine noise present at all speed but not to the point that it be bothersome in my opinion if you be look for a dead quiet ride i recommend precede d the handle be not sport car quality either but predictable and reliable solid the turn radius be quite tight make for easy quick park u turn and other maneuver seat comfort be good i ve drive it 10 hour nonstop without cause much softness or bother the dashboard of the period might take a little get use to but it make sense the digital redoubt be a little strange but be completely functional and we will design the heat ac switch be easy to understand a be the sterno windshield wipe and cruise control the a c when run full blast be cold i strongly suspect an 8 year old could drive the period it be that be ample the neutral much ha be say about the period s look some say it be ugly some say it be wire i say it look just fine for me the son a mention above the period be not the most insular of ride bad road will be felt and hear while drive just a good road make for a very pleasant ride suzuki make a 100 center console arrest for the period i believe this should come include a it would increase drive comfort significantly a pet nerve of mine be that the a c always run when the front defoe defroster be on while this make it work very we will i would have prefer to have the choice of run the defoe frost and a c together rather than have them link the rear tray that cover the luggage area be a little fly amy i no long use it at all but this be because when i do it become clear that take it out and replace it often would probably lead to it be break in the near future when i be jam to loud music the door speaker can some jam vibrate cause a buzz noise otherwise the sterno be great and i ve discover that the buzz stop if one crack each window a cent after or so the mesh use on the seat and door seem to hold soil more than other fabric but all in all after my first 15 000 mile i can make the follow conclusion i love my period i drive my period whenever i can my wife hardly drive anymore the period be an excellent value the period be versatile great for move stuff road trip and passenger the period be fun
496;Camera;i run the national center for child safety in tennessee and i buy this camera to use in school and daycare in order to create id card for child this entail literally thousand of picture per month i purchase the ff 90 because it have the desire picture quality that i wa look for for the purpose of child be this camera be perfect it be unable and the photo quality of a small driver s license type photo be incredible however i be not completely comfortable use this camera a the conventional family camera capture special moment and save vacation memory forever why several reason first of all most people would want to take special photo on the high resolution while the high resolution set will take picture that look rather stun on your computer screen print them be another story a suitable printer that be capable of print the picture at a quality you would want to keep would cost several hundred dollar furthermore at the high resolution the ff 90 will only take 3 5 picture per floppy disk this mean that if you be away from your vacation cottage for a day you will have to leg around at least 5 disk if you want to take 25 picture you can purchase a quit memory stick quit that will store about 60 70 picture but this be a very price option all thing consider it will run you about 150 or more not an easy task if you be try to travel light not to mention the size and considerable bulk of the camera it itself however if you be absolutely convince that you want to go digital i would suggest this camera over any other that i ve try in my business which include most in the sonya mavra line it can do incredible thing to photo by virtue of it be myriad picture effect and shutter speed set charge the battery be easy and relatively quick a completely run down battery can be charge in a little a 2 hour if you buy this or any other digital camera with the intent of edit and print many picture i would suggest that you invest in a good picture edit software do not be fool by the peg movie feature the resolution be low and it generally only take about 15 second of forage in other word do not invest in this camera if you be think it can be both your still and motion camera br br

501;Camera;be you one of those people who purchase a webcam or a digital camera five year ago and consider yourself a leader have you upgrade that purchase since then if not you might be surprise to find what be out there and the function that have be add to make the webcam experience and the digital camera experience more fun my fiance ha long push me to purchase an expensive digital camera one that we could on vacation or to the shore and not worry about it every second of the trip yet one that still take decent photo sure you can not the throw away digital camera but the photo quality be still lack hence the smile on my face when i come upon the logitech clicksmart 420 solid digital camera that will not break the bank the specific up to 1 3 megapixel picture 8 megabyte internal flash memory storage for over 80 picture and 70 second of video video capture resolution of 320 x 240 a a digital camera video capture resolution of 640 x 480 pipe a a webcam build in microphone and try option picture format include peg and vi four ana battery one touch flash delete and ti ame function wrist strap and lens cover there be other specific that be more i important to the serious photographer but i do not list them the reason be that this be a not a digital camera for the serious photographer the 420 be a solid digital camera that be probably not go to be the best camera that you own what i like 1 ease of use the 420 be almost all one touch you can delete picture with one touch and set the flash and ti ame function with just a touch you can also take a photo and send an email with just a single touch neck download the software be just a few step more than a single touch anyone can learn and use this in a short period of ti ame 2 the price quality debate like i mention this be not a great camera but for the price i would argue that it be pretty good the photo and option be not go to be a good a what you get with your 1 000 00 digital camera but they will be fairly good from ti ame to ti ame i will find that i get a photo that be not of great quality so what with a digital camera you si amply delete it and try again consider that you be pay le than 100 for the 420 i think you will agree that the quality be pretty good 3 the ability to send photo over the internet this ha always be one of the more annoy aspect of the digital camera for me i purchase my parent a 800 digital camera last christmas and we still struggle with the picture share function the 420 make thing fairly easy you have the u cable and the lock station and then the software then you si amply take a photo or video a you would normally and save it finally you put the camera in the lock station and select the picture or video you want to email and click the send button that be it and the beauty of it be that it work you can also send to a mac or a pp 4 the disability ok this be the reason we buy the 420 the 420 ha round edge that make a drop le painful and a rubber and plastic cause that make the drop harmless the piece be put together we will enough that you can drop the camera on the beach and not suffer from sand ruin thing now let me back up a second and mention that we have not try these thing but you can feel the stoutness of the design and the disability that the rubber provide 5 we be not there yet but a great camera for kiss first of all the disability mention above make the 420 a nice camera for kiss secondly the round edge mean le likelihood of a nasty fall thirdly the large button provide for ease of use finally the one touch operation make the 420 easy to learn hence the 420 be truly a good camera for a child 6 the dual function of webcam digital camera i do not use the webcam function all that often but when i do i like a webcam that i can depend on often jam this will depend on what service you be use all man yakov etc but it also often depend on the webcam it itself the 420 work with all the major i be platform and provide video and audit option along with the standard chat the webcam option provide a clear picture on both end of the spectrum a big change no long be you stick with a webcam that need a bright light in order for the other person to see you hallelujah and axis note webcam function be very easy to use 7 the memory be pretty good you can save 80 picture without download and that be more than i will ever have on a camera at a single ti ame remember if you would not like a photo you can delete it find 80 picture that you like from say a single trip be a lot the same go for the 70 second of video while this be not a lot of ti ame it be enough to capture a video of something unexpected or special that you otherwise would have miss 8 customer service i be not sure that be the right term for what i mean but it will have to work logitech ha always provide me with a good customer service option the people people know what they be talk about and the wait be usually not too long i also find that the two year product guarantee be a nice touch i doubt i will need to use the customer service line or the guarantee but it be nice to know that both be available and useful what i do not like 1 the battery the 420 run on four ana battery you cannonade a decent amount of picture but the video function be go to oris note battery quickly aside from keep the cost down i be not sure why logitech do not go ahead and utilize a good battery 2 the memory be pretty good aside from keep the cost down i be not sure why logitech do not provide the option of a memory stick or something si similar in order to expand the available memory i will never go over the 80 picture that can be save but you may in this day and age logitech drop the ball by not include this option with the 420 the bottom line we purchase the logitech clicksmart 420 a a second digital camera webcam and it ha meet our high expectation we want something that we would not stress about while on vacation we would not want to have to worry about it on the beach or fret over it fall out of the golf cart we want a good camera that would do what we ask of it take a decent picture be trouble free and easy to use finally we would not want to spend a lot of money since this wa go to be a second camera for u i would highly recommend the 420 for someone look for a solid second camera a start digital camera or a camera for a child the 420 be easy to use unable and price reasonably
502;Camera;i do not do too much homework in select this particular model at the ti ame i wa look to upgrade from my 2 1 megapixel camera to a 3 megapixel camera without have to pay the current price so i spend my ti ame lurk around the bid webster and will note bid on this particular model for those who do not mind get yesteryear s technology with the model be refurbish this be a great webster to buy from i have a few band in mind and let just say this wa one of them i felt comfortable in purchase in spite of all the support shortcoming with this model they can be easily cure first most people have complain about the short battery life and it be somewhat proprietary battery i ve solve this problem by buy a third party battery pack masha that allow me to shoot with the monitor on for easily 5 hour and the battery wa still strong second issue with the small compact flash card provide we will that be a standard practice and i ve be able to use quite a few offhand card in the camera si ample technology dan elect i o data with no problem third the problem with the on off switch be easily trip my suggestion be to reverse the battery and this will prevent inadvertent power now a to my observation on this model yes this model be very compact which be great for those who might be traveler or those with small to average hand but those with large hand might have trouble overgripping this model the room between the grip and lens be pretty small now the lens doe protrude so it would be hard to displace a finger over the lens but the other hand might inadvertently cover the flash or viewfinder this model come with the capability for automatic mode and manual set i must say that if you be the type that doe not enjoy read manual to find out about detail do not get this camera it ha an overlay engineer menu and for some function you have to be push down on two control si simultaneously aperture shutter speed iso set with regard to the point and shoot capability the camera ha some appeal feature the shutter button can be depress partially to lock in a focus set when the focus be not in the center of the frame for a little more trouble one can switch to some ten specialize set while in scene for optic amaze camera function to capture portrait indoor party sunset firework etc now with regard to the more advance set i wa a bite disappoint first the aperture set only allow you to choose the outside range only set the shutter aperture and iso require manipulation of two control si simultaneously which be not conduce for rapid shoot if you would not mind spend a couple of hour pore over the feature than you probably will not mind the complexity my overall i impression of this camera be favorable for the follow reason it be a compact model and the body be entirely plastic which make for a very lightweight model this come in handy when one ha extension lens on the camera there be multiple set besides the point and shoot mode allow one to customize the aperture shutter and iso sensitivity one feature for those who like to know exact set for every shoot will enjoy the playback feature which list all the photographic set for each shoot and this information can be download to a text file besides the good selection of don accessory for this model quite a few third party add can be find compare this model to more update model in the union line 885 i do not feel like i wa lose that much the room range be x versus 2 x otherwise all the functionality seem to be the same in both model
503;Camera;not me that wa my peri mary reason for purchase this camera i want to carry around something with me that take great picture do not require film and could fit in my pocket more or le luckily a co worker purchase this same camera before me and let me test drive it for a weekend i love it i take picture use the medium size 1280x1024 and medium compression and when i receive my print from foot i wa in awe they we be indistinguishable from film i be not a train pro or anything but that doe not matter to me i just want great print that i could send to my parent and friend i ve be to china four ti jam in the past year not to mention many miscellaneous excursion in the western u s and have find the camera to be a great travel companion it be a great tool to preserve memory while i love my s it be not without it be flaw first i have to buy the battery and charge separately they kit cost me about 75 if i remember correctly not very cheap also you be unable to get a and battery separately you have to buy another charge i have not check in a while on this though second the shutter be kind slow there be very noticeable delay from the ti ame you press the button and the ti ame the camera actually capture the i damage this be result in countless blur i damage from let people who be not use to the delay take picture for me they end up snap the picture and not realize they have to wait an extra second for the camera to capture the i damage start move to return the camera to me when i check the camera the i damage be blur use the small screen you can not always tell the i damage be blur either another downside my third major complex not be the room and the horrible digital room the room be only x and that really doe not do much i be use to a 250mm room on my old sir and this be nothing close luckily i have not have much occasion to use the room so it hasn t be too bad live with the room oh and the digital room be not unable at all it be slow and look very bad the minor complex not i have be disability i be not one to really paper my electronics especially break around china but i ve try to take fairly good care of my camera the camera be still intact the screen and body however be pretty scratch up i do not really care about this a long a the camera work but some of you may after all the complex not i ve come to realize that this be a fairly first generation product but a damn good one the negative i point out above be far outweigh by the compactness and picture quality of the camera i could not be happy with this camera we will except if i could by an extra battery without another charge

507;Camera;i buy my mavra a little over 7 month ago i quickly grow to really appreciate it be great photo quality and it be overall ease of use and convenience it be a great camera which i rely on for many of my picture take need some of the thing which i really enjoy about it be 1 excellent photo quality currently i be take most of my picture at 640x480 resolution and the quality be set to fine at this rate i can put about 14 16 snapshot of above average quality on each disk if i want to take a quit nice quit picture i just need to increase the resolution i ve print picture from it a we will a post them online and in both case i ve felt that the picture we be of excellent quality i wa even able to frame a couple of the one that i print 2 us floppy to store picture floppy be excellent for store picture instead of have to travel with multiple roll of film or have to buy several expensive medium card of some sort i just carry around a box of 20 25 floppy which i can leave in the camera bag when i be take picture it might not be the small set you can carry around but it be quite practical for most picture take situation 3 easy to download picture the floppy make it easy for you to download photo to any computer you want to you would not need to drag the camera over to one particular machine in order to use a cable or use special software to download it you just pop out the disk and put it in a disk drive the picture file be save a jug so they can be view with almost any graphic program 4 very easy to use this be a very si ample camera to use it doe require that you spend some ti ame learn to use it and get familiar with it be control but for the most part that be normal for all good camera it ha many many nice feature which you would not need to use often but most of it be main control be handle from on screen venus on the lead screen navigation the venus be easy and when it come down to it take the picture just require that you point and shoot the only reason that i would say this camera be not intuition to use be that it ha so many function it take some ti ame to familiarity yourself with we be they be if you get this camera spend a weekend play around with it and test out all of it be feature and you will feel quite comfortable use it some thing which i find somewhat annoy 1 slow to write data to disk this be the most annoy problem with this camera it take between 5 15 second for it to record each picture on the disk during this ti ame you can not do anything with the camera in most situation this be not a huge problem but it can be frustration i have also notice that it take it long to finish write a picture if you have loom in on your subject 2 battery peter can be inaccurate if you would extensive file view etc the battery can wear out surprisingly fast not only that but the peter tend to not report accurately while you be view file in general though once you know this you can be careful and the battery will last for quite a while 3 somewhat large bulky this be not a small camera it be a fair bite big than small point and shoot camera and it be big than the body of most sir this be not a major drawback but it can be somewhat annoy when you be pack for a trip it be fairly light though so it be extra size doe not really affect it be overall liability 4 peg quality be not great the quality of it be peg be not really good i ve try different option but it just doe not produce output which i be satisfy with this be almost certainly because this be peri angrily a camera for still photograph which also happen to record some video it be possible to record the occasional ok peg but i do not think that irony spend much effort on this particular feature all thing consider i really do like this camera it doe have a few thing which i find somewhat troublesome but none of them be really that terrible i only mention them so that people with specific camera need be not take by surprise for instance this be not a great camera for record high action sport type shoot it be also not good a a video camera if you be look for a good reliable camera which be very flexible and easy to work then you should definitely consider this it be output be top notch while it be not quite up to par with the best sir camera out there it easily candle 90 of the photography task which you might encounter and it give you great result br br

509;Camera;i have be hint at a digital camera for christmas but wa surprise when my husband actually get one after talk to several people both sale people and those that have digital camera he choose the polypus d 490 room it be be very easy to figure out with the help of the manual the manual it itself be easy to understand and it be not difficult to find something if i have a question the camera can be use in two different way you can si amply open the cover and point and shoot or you can also open the lens cover and view your subject through the monitor much like look through a can order screen so far the picture have be of good quality though i have not try to print one out yet because my main objective at this point be to email picture to friend and family i can choose a low resolution set and get more picture at a ti ame but if i choose to print it be very easy to change the set to a high resolution i d like to have a few of the accessory but the camera work just fine without them they would just make the download to my computer easy and fast i have an old computer so it take a couple of minute to download but not so long that it get frustration
510;Auto;i have find my inner child and he be a thirteen year old boy this be a tremendous discovery for someone s mother to make if you ask me but i think it be true the whole thing start because my old make re 7 need work a lot of work i own the car outright but it have reach the age where it wa go to take thousand of dollar a couple of ti jam a year to keep it drive anything like i want despite argument from my significant other my emotional attachment to the re 7 my first ever fun car wa such that i really do plan to just keep fix it again and again or else replace it with a new re 7 if i could find one we will just a i wa about to finally bite the bullet and get major transmission work do on the re 7 my main squeeze throw me and our two year old son in his van and take me out to a car lot where side by side sit a use coquette and a new re 7 turn i test drive the re 7 and find it be similar to the one i already have only with absolutely zero cargo space i plan to test drive the cette but they would lock the key in the car inspire though i head to the they leadership to see if they have any use veto and they would but not in my price range to my surprise though the showroom floor camera be wa available at a price i could talk myself into tingle a little inside i take a camera be for a test drive i wa surprise by how much i like it ton of zip enough cargo space to pick up a reasonable load of grocery if i need to comfortable seat that we be even big enough for my son s car seat if only i like the way it look i thank the they dealer for the test drive and head up the street to the pontiac dealer where i find a bargain a low mile bright red 1995 trans be six speed with the burst sister half the price of the new camera be so i take that one for a ride too first of all i have bad knee so a few year ago i come to grip with the notion that i would not be drive stick anymore it have be year but it come right back drive that fun car a little slow stop and start around surface street then out onto the highway and next thing i know there i be in th severely over the speed li amid at 1500 rum i take the car out of gear get off the freely and go back to the leadership angel on one shoulder say quit but remember you can not drive stick anymore remember your knee shake in traffic quit and devil on the other say quit who care who care this car rule quit this like i say be where the teenage boy come in i look at every trans be on that lot unlike the cameron they would not have any automatic in stock i work that dealer have hi be show me every little feature of every trans be and then i get back in the age re 7 and responsible drive home without buy a stick but back at the house i start my trans be research in earnest i wa intrigue to compare firebird and cameron learn that more cameron be make than firebird that a large percentage of woman buy firebird than cameron while the opposite be true of cameron i walk around for a few day say thing like quit hey it be a version of the coquette engine quit and quit i think traction control would be a major plus quit and quit okay can you explain note difference between gear ratio and able ratio quit just like that i d manage to tell myself i could never my emotional bond with my re 7 and i know that i want to replace it with a hetty american ve for a new sport car that mean i have 3 option firebird camera or mustn for a slightly use car a coquette frankly i just do not like the look of the new mustn at all and to get the same horsepower that be standard with a camera or firebird i would have have to spring for a mustn sit court with a high stick price than i want to pay for a car who be look i do not like and which i constantly see lot of on the road anyway what be more i fail to see why the absolute top of the line mustn the sit court r actually get any play when you could buy a new coquette for the same price people actually pick a mustn over a cette ford must have some advertise whiz but naaaah the mustn wa never a contend for me the use coquette wa however after a fair amount of contemplation i decide that what i really want to do wa buy my first brand new car where i get to pick out the colour and everything and it come with a solid warranty and no mile on it and it would be mine from the very begin so back to camera v firebird first of all the base ve wa right out i be sure it be a great car but after drive the 305 horsepower v i have to have one i do not even bother to test drive the 200 horsepower ve firebird or camera if i d be in the market for a ve however either the camera or the firebird would have be a hand down win over the ve mustn which i ve rent and frankly enjoy le than a carry which be too bad because i want to like the mustn decide between the camera and firebird end up be easy than one might think while i like the way the camera handle and it be feature and option and while the price wa right and there we be plenty of camera see around that we be automatic transmission the bottom line be i like the look of the trans be good it take me the good part of a week to find an automatic trans be to test drive to be sure i like the way the automatic transmission felt deep down the teenage boy inside me keep holler the whole ti ame quit you would not care so what about your knee get this one get it get it yeah do not drive the die re 7 off this lot quit when i finally find one it wa an automatic trans be with the wa performance package on it and it wa a 2001 which mean i would not be able to take advantage of the 1500 debate for the 2000 model year and the bottom line there wa that the car wa just a little more expensive than i really want to pay for feature that i wa not likely to ever really capitalist on 17 quit wheel 15 more horse and the functional scoop with rough look hood for example i end up pick out an automatic trans be to be deliver from about a hundred mile away with the only option be choke wheel traction control and the quit performance able quit with the 3 23 ratio while the wait for the car to be deliver wa sheer torture i could not be happy with the vehicle first of all i be thrill with it be pure lymph i be learn to drive all over again if i drive this car the way i drive the re 7 i be go to get arrest step anything but lightly on the accelerate when the light turn green and the tire will squeal this car be very quick off the line the same kind of drive that would keep me reasonably in step with other car before now leaf me see them far back in the rear view mirror of course this mean i ve get to be vigilant if i be not the first one up at the light pick be exceptional even at highway speed this mean the car really be terrific in california freely traffic if i need to be somewhere else fast it be no problem it be great to have the power to accelerate out of potentially sticky situation even when the overall flow of traffic be already exceed the speed li amid i be also very happy with break since i do not have downshifting for an add measure of control in an automatic and the car s overall responsiveness take a week of silicon valley drive and you be guarantee a few chance to find out how your car react to adverse traffic scenario while i ve hear complex not about visibility i have to say it be superior to what i have in the re 7 yes the rear window be short so you would not get a tall view of the road there and that take some get use to a doe see the rear spoil in the reflection however the side mirror be excellent and the glance over the shoulder blind spot be much small than the one i have with the re 7 which wa enough of a blind spot to hide an entire go retro ask me how i learn that one i do not get the driver s seat with lumbar support just the basic 6 way power seat if i we be expect to do nonstop roadtrips or if i already have back problem i would likely have often for the upgrade seat but i be perfectly happy with this one and suspect i would be even for the occasional roadtrip however i expect a passenger would want to make more frequent stop to stretch his leg give the lump in the floor which i understand hide the paralytic convert and no one but a child could make a roadtrip in this vehicle a a back seat passenger speak of child my son s toller car seat fit quite nicely in the back and there be ether strap anchor point for two car seat while i think his view wa good from the passenger seat of the two seat re 7 in the trans be he can watch all the mirror and ha the view out the tint glass t top although he wouldoes tend to kick the passenger seat some he be get enough room to be comfortable and his major problem appear to be when we stop he will start scream quit go go go car quit i also find that it be nice to be able to reach easily to hand hi be thing and so forth without have to tell hi be to keep his hand off the shift and not kick the sterno like in a 2 seat and of course i love it that now all three people in our family can go for a ride in the fun car at once the sterno be great i do not opt for the 12 d change fire that if i do someday decide i want one i can probably find one that will work with the car s head unit for under 600 the price of the factory instal change i be definitely go to get spoil by the radio control on the sneer wheel too i be thrill with the t top a an open air alternative to a convertible lot more openness than even a huge power moorhof give me on the re 7 and little enough wind turbulence that even though i have three foot of hair i be comfortable and hair doe not get blow in my face restrict my vision an equally long haired passenger report the same thing i ve be advise about the t top to snatch them in the event that the car ever need to be pack up so a to avoid any potential true be apply to that part of the car which could result in a lecky t top by the same token the manual say never to take the car through a car wash that spray high pressure water in the area of the t top so it look like this will be a wash by hand car forever what be more the manual say the choke wheel be prone to damage by brush in a car wash so i guess i ll be wash it and make periodic visit to the scale car detail though classify a a sub compact this be a big car than you would think it be nearly a long a my main squeeze s extend my salary and weigh in at 3500 pound almost a much a a couple neville and more than a they s 10 pick this car weigh a much a some sum so you can not drive it like you would a lightweight vehicle nor doe this vehicle get subcompact gas mileage for silicon valley traffic drive admittedly with the air condition on i seem to be get about 17 mile to the gallon the list of standard feature on a trans be be truly exceptional especially for the price no it doe not have the full complement of luxury sedan feature but one would not expect it to but the list of standard equipment be long enough that it barely fit in the section for it on the car s window stick overall i would wholeheartedly recommend this car to anyone who want a fun fast car with a few cavern you will not be able to fit a huge amount of cargo in it though it be get adequate space you will not be able to carry around a gargle of your friend and it will be anything but cheap to fill it with the premium gas the manual sternly recommend additional i would not recommend this car to an inexperienced driver the steep rake angle of the hood make it hard to get a feel for where the car end and si similarly it be hard to know this move in reverse far with the major amount of lymph right at all speed i ve drive so far and a top speed that be suppose to be 160 may i would not recommend this for a driver who be inexperienced or prone to recklessness which be bad news i suppose for teenage boy who be not inner child br br
511;Auto;why buy a fore over a cry pro much more powerful engine 165 he v 125 he much safe only mind sun without follower warn much more for your dollar sugar s all wheel drive system be amaze son more expensive to insure due to average cost of repair we love the room feel and cost of this vehicle we hate the price of repair on it who should drive this vehicle small family who want an economical vehicle that offer some room for ship and be safe our story after quite an exhaustive comparison process we purchase a fore over a hand cry we have be mind make up before even shop for a mind sun on a hand cry we test drive the cry and think it wa great we put a down payment down they say that we could have a week to think about it during this week i wa avert by the safety report on mind sun s after far investigation i discover that the fore have the only acceptable crash test result of a car in it be class we go out and test drive a sugar right of the bat you notice a huge power difference in the fore over the cry this make sense when you consider the 165 he v 125 he engine difference the all wheel drive system in the sugar be i impressive live in minnesota you can it be a huge plus over the cry the one we test wa and a for price the cry appear cheap but if you compare the base model fore l which ha and a c power window lock a and then the base model cry plus the and option a option and the power window lock you be look at a save of roughly 1500 dollar on the sugar a for space they we be both pretty equal both lack the leg room in the back seat but that be to be expect with a mind sun both have ample room once the back seat we be low the only drawback in the fore be the price to insure the cry be le expensive to insure this price be base on the average cost of repair br br
512;Auto;i buy a 2001 coolly le in august 2000 and have put on about 50 000 mile i originally own an 83 term that teach me the virtue of a long last si ample automobile i drive cross country six ti jam in the voter and only have to change a fuel pump and some warp rostov along the way but those happen we will after the car have 100 000 mile ok back to the coolly after live in baltic more for a couple of year the exterior ha an interest assortment of king debt and scratch but the interior be pure gold no problem with any mechanical or electrical system everything work just like the day i buy it fuel economy be excellent and i be the type of person who calculate it religious i have a 5 speed and i usually average 38 39 pg with mostly highway drive if i do more in town drive that might drop to about 36 pg performance be fair to middle acceleration be slow in first gear second be good and third ha some muscle the clutch be not too forgive and take some practice and the hair trigger accelerate doe not help matter much i ve do some severe weather drive and the car be sure loot in snow and rain front wheel drive and the manual transmission do the trick break be ok but require more force on the pedal than one might be use to especially in an emergency situation handle be fairly tight but the car s cheap suspension and 14 inch wheel show up on bump terrain despite occasional discomfort the suspension appear to be hardy have deal with baltic more s awful street without any repair to date and a high speed i impact with a rock on the highway do not cause any damage beyond a tire let s talk about size for a moment i be 6 foot 5 inch tall and i be at my li amid in term of interior space and forget it for the person in the back seat behind me but the weird thing be i ve sit in a lot of so call big car and they be all bad even the new cadillacs one notable exception be the volkswagen golf which ha a great front seat and lot of bedroom the coolly ha pretty generous head room but the leg room be tight i recommend cruise control so at least you can move around a little on long trip interior economics be efficient and to the point control and display be easy to use and design to last the cruise control ha a great feature where you can push the lever up to go 1 may fast or down to go 1 may slow i also like the automatic headlight you never have to worry about turn them on or off good design extend to the engine compartment all the fluid be very easy to check and refill if necessary the air filter and lightbulb be easy to change too the engine it itself be all aluminium and you would not see the usual copious amount of plastic there be a generous space between the jumper and the engine which would save lot of dough in a front end crash in this age of monster sum the issue be go to be be it too small but let me point out the benefit tight turn circle get into those park spot nobody else can and the ability to weave through city traffic the coolly ha a big trunk no problem pack up for a two week vacation and on smooth road you can pretend you be in a much big car another advantage of small be affordability i pay 15 grand include tax and tag a pretty good deal consider how long i expect the car to last base on my past experience with the term 200 000 mile be a reasonable life ame for the coolly and the repair i expect to make be new rake 300 and tire 350 around ask mile and again at 150k and possibly a new alternate 300 start 300 strut 300 and waterpump 300 around 100 150k mile ok maybe the fuel pump 200 at some point too the exhaust system and ac last forever on the coolly accord to consumer report survey the key be that these item be easy to identify when they break and do not rack up the bill for labor by the way these price assume that you never never take your car to the dealer which be the multi mate no no if you want to save money on car repair with the coolly you can gleefully ignore the recommend serve just have your local mechanic check thing when you go in for an oil change look for that gas station repair shop with a guy name chip mike steve or joe that ll be your place the coolly be a car for people that want to or have to drive in an urban suburban environment without worry about thing break and save lot of money along the way this be the car that will take a lick and keep on tick but it be still a big step up from my old no ac be radio voter which i affectionately call the lawnmower with wheel

515;Camera;a the heir apparent to the c 2500l from polypus i expect great thing from the c 2100uz my expectation we be perhaps a little too high the c 2100 feature a six optical room this be far good than most other consumer and presume camera digital or not it us smartmedia for storage and ship with an mb card a lens cover and shoulder strap be include four a ni be battery and a charge be include

window 2000 or mac o 9 will work with the camera polypus make a point of note that even u equip machine that have be upgrade to window 98 from window 95 will not work with the camera an a v cable be supply for connect to television and very the maxim alum resolution of the camera be 1600x1200 or 2 1 megapixels this be le than other current lead edge camera feature the camera can save in stiff or peg and can also capture short 30 see quickly ame movie clip with sound at 15 frame per second a continuous drive mode can capture about seven super high quality shoot in about four second ti ame that doe not include the ti ame it take to save the i damage to the memory card an infra red remote be include for ti amid shoot the c 2100uz be style a an sir camera camera in this category be identify by their ability to accurately frame picture by use through the lens til view finger while this make a big difference on traditional film camera it be not a big a sell point on digital camera which use lead display that by their very nature display til i damage that can be use for frame a shoot of the few sir digital camera available the benefit to the til viewfinder be that the i damage be purely optical that be you can see all the detail that a lead screen can not display the c 2100 break this tradition by use a miniature lead in the viewfinder instead of optic this give the camera a video camera type of feel the benefit of this set be the massive amount of set information that can be display while frame a picture include the effect of exposure compensation the drawback be the lack of fine detail that true optic provide back to the benefit playback can be do on the viewfinder s lead which us far le power than the large rear mount lead a button switch the display between the mind lead and the large lead at any ti ame during capture or playback the camera s i amaze senior cod support iso equivalent sensitivity of 100 200 and 400 in point and shoot mode the camera can select between these set automatically expect a tendency to use a high film speed when set to auto mode a with all digital camera there be a significant amount of i damage noise capture when high speed be use the manual control for shutter speed aperture and manual focus be very flexible more flexible than even the c 2500l s control the manual focus control could have be make a little easy to use although it be feature of enlarge the i damage to show more detail while adjust be handy shutter priority and aperture priority mode be available in addition to a full manual mode a handful of special

shoot camera so expect to take some ti ame to learn all the set to get full use out of the camera operation of the camera wa not speedy but it wa not a dog either playback we be fairly fast when capture cycle ti ame between single shoot wa about three second power on to first shoot wa four to five second without flash continuous drive shoot we be about two to three frame per second without flash expect delay when take multiple shoot while the camera save to the slow smartmedia memory card by the way what be up with polypus only supply an mb card it can only hold about sixteen shoot the c 2100 s predecessor the c 2500l ship with a limb card get a big card if your go to use this camera i wa disappoint that the resolution of the camera wa only 2 1 megapixels with the industry trend to create high resolution picture for good print this be a step backwards the amaze six room almost make up for this quit flaw quit for those look to get close to the action you can not find much good than the room capability of this camera couple with a 2 x continuous digital room total six room you will not find a solution in this price range that can beat the c 2100 for me however superior print be more desirable than high room level actual picture quality wa good but i do notice poor color accuracy in low light situation when a flash wa not use when a flash be use careful control need to be use so that your subject be not wash out i damage sharpness wa good the build in focus assist light allow the camera to focus in low light with little difficulty of course i damage capture at high iso set we be fraught with fix noise i damage capture at iso 100 we be a clean a can be expect overall i would recommend this camera to those need exceptional room capability who be not look to print the i damage at large size there be good alternative for those look for good quality i damage or fast camera these alternative include other camera from polypus like the e 10 4 megapixel x room and the e 100 be 1 5 megapixel six room 15 frame per second br br

519;Camera;over all union 880 carry on the reputation of great union optic and design over i damage quality be great a long a the i damage compression be at fine or high design camera body be very compact i wish it ha a riot lead viewfinder a union 990 or the canon go you would have to remember to set control dial to play or set to avoid accidentally turn on the camera with lens cap on it will jam the lens though it happen quite a lot of ti ame and do not really do any damage to mine control i do notice some reliability of shutter control to hold half way so when you be get a new one test it out on some camera you can not hold halfway at all it be i important when you want to hold the focus etc optic good overall doe have noticeable barrel distortion but ok for most of the landscape shoot fast room control yet focus be a little slow micro function be amaze you can get easily great photo close up still and available lens accessory share with union 990 be very useful ability to scan side be truly unique and the result be quite ok battery life 2 rechargeable battery be expensive investment but absolutely essential for serious shutter and should be enough for a whole day field trip overall battery life be very good expect rotatable lead viewfinder already realize in the new model a easy way to attach a filter lens this represent a problem for most of the compact dig come with intractable lens

523;Camera;note update 150 5 2 03 i have update the original hope this review will be useful in help you all i have add more information such a lens flare graininess etc p s i be still on the original bundle alkaline battery so now 5 star for energy efficiency now i have take about a hundred high quality shoot and about 20 minute of video and frequent use of lead for review etc flash use be moderate b first a little want on choose either and or and b the powershot and be almost identical to the 3 meg fix and physically the only difference be a gray handgrip on the and while the and s be blue functional difference be 640x480 movie mode for the and slightly fast multiple picture shoot about 2 6 fa v 2 2 fa and of course the increase in meg pipe so if you would not need the extra pipe for print 8x10 or large picture the and will give you almost the same feature a the and both camera support direct print to compatible printer such a canon up 10 and s800d note the and 146s max resolution be actually adequate to produce decent 8 x 10 print a i 146ve try it myself you might think that since it 146s only 100 more why not get the and anyway for the high pipe we will because if you be never go to print such large picture which us a lot of ink and be expensive to print with ink jet printer or a va movie mode which really need a huge compact flash card then you be really pay for pipe you 146ll never use so why not use the 100 to buy an extra set of rechargeable battery and a fast travel charge that 146s good investment a digital be unlike a computer more pipe doe not mean future droop unlike pu where more megahertz or cup clock speed mean good future droop you only need a much pipe depend on the size of photo you will need to print with good detail buy accessory 133 if you buy the and you could probably get a 128mb compactflash card a mind u cf card reader and a soft case with the money save from not get the and or you could opt for a limb card and a set of ni be battery and charge or you could use the money save to get a set of photo ink cartridge and photo paper for your printer of course if you have the money to spare then go ahead with the and the and shoot up to 1600 x 1200 and the and up to 2048 x 1536 pipe i normally shoot at 1600 x 1200 which be sufficient to produce great 5 x 7 photo and decent 8 x 10 a i 146ve experience this low resolution compare to the and 146s max yes also allow me to take more picture with the bundle 16 megabyte card the camera be very comfortable to hold with a large handgrip also part of the battery compartment it 146s a bite stubby though and weigh around 300 grass with battery this mean it 146s comfortable and steady in your hand but will not fit small pocket a easily a a sonya up nor a portable in the box 133 the camera come with a 16 megabyte compact flash card a wrist strap software and camera manual two software co 4 a alkaline battery u and video out table no soft case be include but i get one for free the 16 megabyte card be too small by today 146s standard you can only take about 16 picture at the high quality set the camera be recognize automatically by window up but on old system you will need to install the software driver now i 146ll get straight to what you probably want to know how doe it perform performance ever since get this camera i have take about 3 dozen photo of various subject range from kiss to pet and close up of plant and and amass i wish i can post these picture here iso you can see for yourself that this canon take excellent quality photo of course you can also visit the many webster out there that feature review and sample picture take with the and or and judge for yourself but i be extremely satisfy with the quality myself detail be excellent especially in close up and portrait indoor picture with flash come out excellent a we will this be take with the auto mode on there be 12 shoot mode all in all color such a skin tone be spot on a we will start ti ame be about 3 second before you can begin shoot shutter law be hardly there in bright daylight or fast shutter speed but become more apparent when shoot in dark indoors or at night still very fast response in my use my previous digital wa a first generation 0 8 meg fix full and the picture take we be too warm i 146m really surprise at how far digicams have come today to produce the best and most accurate color even in tricky indoor light condition i have print out only three photo on my home canon bubble jet printer 4 x 6 and the result quite good with my old full i often have to correct and adjust the picture before print but with this camera little adjustment and color correction be need picture softness b i have also send off my cf card for process at a digital color lab fujifilm digital i amaze and the result although a bite soft a testify by many other and and owner look very please with very good color and decent detail level the softness can easily be correct through software sharpen before be print out and even if sharpen be not do it 146s still not that big of a deal especially consider how many other positive the camera ha go for it i also notice that sharp digital picture also look grinder most ti jam the picture on the and may not be super sharp but there be very little grain especially at either iso 50 or iso 100 i hear the same be true for the s but have not see picture from the new go i have handle the old go and it 146s just too bulky and heavy for my purpose but picture be gorgeous a for lens flare i notice a bite of it when shoot with the bright sun in the background or directly at it there be also a bite of flare when shoot oncoming traffic from headlight at night it isn 146t very bad compare with some other camera i have use though in fact it perform good than with my samson camera that 146s equip with a sneichder kreuznach lens which be suppose to be specially coat to mind amie lens flare b creative possibility one of the main reason why i get this camera be because it offer so much creative control such a aperture priority shutter priority program a and full manual control in manual mode you can change all exposure control and set you can select shutter speed of 15 second to 1 2000th of a second aperture size of ff 8 to ff different flash mode auto focus 5 point or center focus or manual focus meet center weight evaluation or spot and many others this be si amply amaze and unbelievable at this price there be even a custom white balance set that you can set with either a white or gray card there be no option to save your custom exposure set though unlike the s which ha one custom set and the go which ha two no big loss all other exposure set remit note same after you set them a the information be store in the camera and his notice by a small lithium battery which also his nothing date for example if you choose shutter priority mode and set your shutter speed at 1 60 it will remit note same when you turn the camera off and then on to manual mode there 146s also a focus assist light which be hardly find in budget digicams very useful for shoot in the dark and also act a the red eye reduction lamp a stitch assist mode let you create splendid panorama shoot by 147stitching 148 together multiple shoot either horizontally or vertically or 360 degree the camera help you align each shoot by show a bite of the previous shoot on the lead very effective and stun result b superb for derby and enthusiast alike many who be new to digicams would probably be happy enough with the auto mode but if you be keen on learn more about photography technique this digital either and or and be the best budget choice unlike a mmm manual camera or sir you wouldn 146t have to be afraid of waste film when expert lament with the various shoot mode and set i take photo of thing around the house at various aperture set and the result be great i use a large aperture such a ff 8 to make the background blur out when take a micro shoot of a flower and a small aperture such a ff to make everything include the background look sharp at ff a try be recommend a slow shutter speed be some jam need especially when the day be cloudy or dark if i didn 146t like any picture i si amply delete it and start over again no more waste mmm film and money waste into develop a whole roll just to get one or two unable photo good range of shutter speed another main reason why i get this camera be because of it be wide range of shutter speed it be slow speed range up to 15 second perfect for take night scene shoot you can also choose digital film sensitivity from iso 50 to iso 400 anything slow than 1 3 second shutter speed will kick in the automatic noise reduction for those of you who don 146t understand what this be let me try to explain when take long exposure shoot noise the stuff that make your film look old and grain be almost always introduce into your picture this become much more severe at high sensitivity such a iso 400 the camera employ an automatic noise reduction system to reduce this effect at slow shutter speed i take a 15 second night shoot no moon just star and some distant city light at iso 50 and the result wa almost noise free needle to say i be much i impress movie mode move be record with sound in my opinion movie mode on digicams be more like i ammicks than practical tool they would however provide a great way to capture small movie file for smile to friend especially after be edit and compress with window movie maker or other edit software the camera record move at 15 frame per second and the sound be monaural i ve only use it twice to record small video of the kiss play a real amusement for the indie b battery life i be still on the original bundle panasonic alkaline at the ti ame of write this after take dozen of high quality picture with lead on and average flash usage i be extremely i impress by it be energy efficiency however i recommend a set of rechargeable high capacity ni be battery personally i use energy 1700 may battery overall i have to say that battery life on this canon be si amply excellent since i also use the lead many ti jam and for review and make many manual mode set and change a we will a connect it to my lawton for download b software window up and mac o user will find that the camera be automatically configure for and unable without instal any of canon 146s bundle software however for more option and control canon 146s room brother offer great versatility i still prefer acdsee for catalogue and browse photo collection though canon include arcsoft 146s photo and video i impression software for make quick adjustment and edit of photo and video far from the best but adequate for derby i find photo i impression difficult and i practical to use with annoy button sound effect that can 146t be turn off or i haven 146t find out how adore photoshop element a tone down version of photoshop would have be an excellent bundle choice instead the bedside i only have one major complex not and that be the flash doe a terrible job throttle down for micro shoot across be take at distance a close a cm or 2 inch across at 5 cm with auto flash result in unstable overexpose picture this be where the manual exposure control come in real handy for example i expert lament by take a close up shoot of the key on a calculate at 5 cm 2 inch range on auto mode the flash wa fire and the picture wa badly overexpose so i switch to manual mode and set the shutter speed at 1 200 and aperture at ff 8 and voila a perfect natural light shoot the calculate key we be perfectly expose all the letter we be legible and clear and detail extremely good right down to the tiny scratch on the calculate surface if you shoot at high resolution you can crop away certain part of your micro shoot to produce a great close up shoot without loss of detail or pixilation and a mention early the camera 146s picture be just a bite soft but this can be sharpen through software edit and a small grip it be cf card compartment cover be very fly amy just wait to break off other than these i have no other major complain highly recommend i highly recommend this camera either model be good depend on your resolution need the camera be make in malasha not in japan which probably help to reduce it be cost it also ha a plastic body with only a metal front panel it allow for far creativity by accept add on micro and telephone lens and filter there be also a waterproof cause available for it no soft case be include in the box so be sure to get one i get one for free the dealer throw one in for free when i complain that none wa include the case be specifically make for the and and and and be of a soft swede like material with good fashion to protect the camera from small bump and scratch in conclusion 133 so what else can i say i be very happy with my 280 purchase you can get it for cheap at some online store so do shop around it 146s a great camera and i have never enjoy take photo a much until now the camera will keep both point and shutter and enthusiast happy indeed especially those on a budget the softness in photo doesn 146t bother me much it really isn 146t that bad the photo be still very beautiful but it might to some others if this be the case then you would have to move into the mid level canon s which doe offer sharp picture but cost a lot more if you have lot of money to burn and want a high quality small compact size camera look at the s nevertheless i have no regret get this and model and buy a large 128 mb cf card rechargeable battery and charge with the money save these canon camera come close and close to the presume professional consumer gas and new gas but be heavy and bulky in term of feature on a scale i think the and and and be at the low budget end while the s sit in the middle and the go at the top the and and and camera be a great move by canon make many advance manual control available to the mass without only unite cash bud to canon b this be how i would rate it b feature 5 star performance 4 star economics and build quality 4 star battery life 5 star value for money 5 star this camera isn 146t perfect or doesn 146t have any flaw but at this price it ha way more pro than son so it frightfully ear it be 5 star rat

trend come back about fifty sixty year ago give or take the peri mary structure of most car wa body body frame body light if you 146re get it it 146s not a completely original design why do you need to know this we will in my own opinion i think it wa a small mistake on 147honda 146s 148 part for the car they make they create a car i damage that wa an i damage of almost all car some year ago but that style die and for a reason i would guess because 133those car we aren 146t all that sharp mean that 147honda 148 do this just to put a car out there they make a car that ha an old trend but they wouldn 146t even make a single thing about the car special or unique in any way just to clear that up and i hear a rumor from somewhere that the hand element in fact wa design follow the print of a old milk truck 133weird b question that will be answer i what be the more for a and ex hand element high model i i how doe the car handle i i what option be available i i what calibre of safety be this car of i i will this car last be this car a worth while investment i i be this car fit for me and my mid size family i b handle handle be what you would expect of a car of this size i turn stop go and mark truly i couldn 146t find anything special than that of the hand civic the only thing that do shine wa the four wheel drive it start good and it seem to pull it itself up hill effortlessly also i have live in numerous state of vary coli mate on the east coast and i cannotell you by personal experience it be a good thing to own a 4 wheel drive car when a blizzard roll in specifically pennsylvania however the handle be not quite affect by the 4 wheel drive a much a you would think you would not stop good turn be not affect to a point you could notice and the car doesn 146t park tight or be easy to maneuver of course 4 wheel drive doesn 146t make you godlike so if you wouldn 146t need 4 wheel drive save some cash and go a different direction drive the 147honda element 148 be like a mix from drive something a a go part extremely maneuverable and very easy to control and responsive or a summer bulky heavy not a responsive or something that can start and stop a quick so in the middle would be the hand element excellent start good stop good turn great park fairly maneuverable and quite responsive handle be what make this car a worthwhile burden to let a good 20 000 dollar out your pocket great in all category and start very we will if you be purchase the 4 wheel drive ex do b the interior comfort and the others i must say it be a beautiful interior especially with black leather seat and a silver dash board it 146s a very modernize interior and i greatly approve of it the dashboard the instrument panel and gauge we be place very we will if anything i would praise hand for their work on the interior of the hand element and if you pick the ex with the proper accessory and option the element 146s interior be a thing of beauty except the flaw of comfort 133 i comfort we will just because it 146s nice look doesn 146t mean it ha to be comfortable and in this case it couldn 146t be anymore true after a few minute of sit in the driver 146s seat the seat that should be make with the most comfort since the driver be the driver my butt wa origin 146 soar i would shift from side to side to help but the seat be just way to stiff whether i wa spoil from more comfortable leather seat i don 146t know all i know be the hand element seat could have be more comfortable and definitely would have be good if they actually we be more comfortable i can 146t find a huge difference with the fabric and leather but i think i can feel the fabric absorb slightly more therefore be soft and more comfortable i others we will there be some attractive catch that come with the hand element such a the complete fold seat front and back why you would ever want to fold all the seat down i don 146t know but it 146s cool right because it 146s there and you can go ahead and do it for fun and then there be the fold out door a new thing hand ha do which open out in opposite way what doe this do it doe 133nothing it might save some space of clearance between the front and back seat and it allow you to open the entire car for yourself if you we be plan to vacuum it or have it inspect whatever you want b engine mileage i fight myself wonder whether or not i should mention the engine power because if you we be even interest in purchase this car the last thing you would have consider would be the engine but hey it would be nice for you to have a vague week at what the hand element 146s engine can provide so 133it 146s your average size 6 cylinder engine maybe a little small than a normal 6 cylinder engine because it be 2 4 liner displacement and i wa surprise to find out the hand element wa not a weak engine it just wasn 146t special with it 146s fair true and 160 horse engine from look alone you would think a car such a the hand element would be a weak sedan but 133it 146s not check my mileage with the hand element i wa get a good 30 mile per gallon you can consider this good since i drive about in the city with a lot of stop go traffic also to mention this car be four wheel drive get the two wheel drive model would raise you gas mileage considerably but don 146t forget you 146ll be sacrifice control for distance we will the car be fair for it 146s gas mileage but in the end it 146s just good because the car be most definitely not fuel conservative or have a horrid 4 cylinder engine so don 146t expect to be amaze you 146ll get best performance with this car if you live possibly in the country flat land don 146t have to much uneven land to navigable or force stop traffic light intersect b safety safety be an extremely i important factor in a car especially one on the ni amble side i be glad to say that the hand element be fairly safe with no award or 4 star award consider the way it wa create if you notice the passenger driver side door you 146ll see that they open out with no reinforcement it can make someone to wonder what a side i impact would do to the car people inside we will the car 146s door be in fact very secure when you close the door steel beam inside the door lock together go ahead and try to judge them open or try and pull to make them sway hand employee will let you would a you please if you feel the need to prove something to yourself and you be will to buy it if you break it then there be some safety feature that be most definitely find in all car of good quality such a the four wheel anti lock a rake and brake turn assist all so vague that you would never know it wa there unless someone wa to take it away in my opinion all good car have this and hand ha make a good car that be safe enough to sustain damage while be versatile enough to never have to be in that situation by the way don 146t be cheap get the front side airbags and all that i mention since all of it be an add safety option i option and automatic transmission front side airbags nighthawk black pearl exterior side step door vigor sunroof security system fog lamp wear tough floor mat burn black leather seat black interior low window be be and d player air condition 147most of the thing mention we be completely optional while others we be your average package that would come with the car 148 these be not my option but the option of the car i test drive to see what the element wa all about more 22 138 not bad for a car that seat four b wrap up to make it be ample there be always some specific part of a car or trait that make it stand out a summer be big a hugo be happy and a mind be small and fuel efficient a far a the hand element go the master trait would be cargo space for such a small car the cargo space be unbearable it be just about a big a any sun trunk and definitely big than any sun trunk that ha a third row of seat hug room so there you have it the hand element an amazingly average car make by the people at hand who we be try to think outside the box 133but all they would wa make a box i hope you enjoy this review and that it will be useful to you at some ame place

534;Camera;first of all let me say i have never even hold a digital camera until my rich rd 6000 arrive at 3 00 pm one afternoon by 4 30 pm i wa smile picture of the cat to my husband at work within 24 hour i have 70 picture of vacation bible school up on the internet for the parent to see it just doe not get much easy than this now let me back up a little when i first open the box and saw all the table and book i think i can not wait for my husband to get home to figure this out a i start handle the camera and look at the literature i think we will at least i can get the battery charge before ted get home can you see where this be go instead of try to figure out everything at once i just keep solve little how to problem and the next thing you know i have take a picture of the box the camera come in the rich rd 6000 can be overwhelm when you first open the box there be so much more than just a camera in there in addition to the camera i find cable for u connection cable for aerial connection cable for television connection ac adapt power cord for ac adapt rechargeable battery 8 mb smartmedia memory card convert cable for round aerial port i think that be what it be camera case camera strap operation manual software manual battery manual the battery ha it be own manual software d for window software d for mass registration questionnaire technical service document a packet of offer and advertisement fifteen minute after open the box i have all these part and manual and document spread out on my kitchen table i attach the strap insert the battery and plug in the ac adapt since i could turn the camera on now and i do not have to wait until the battery wa fully charge i think i d take a few picture a quick glance at the operation manual i find the large dial on the top of the camera turn it to picture take mode and snap away another check of the manual i turn the dial to playback mode and stroll through the picture i have just take there wa no stop me now i turn that dial one more ti ame to delete mode and start over after a few minute of this i want to email the picture to my husband so i get the software manual and the window d follow the very si ample instruction i instal the u driver the rich camera utility and a photo edit software call arcsoft i attach the up cable to the computer and the camera turn that large dial on top of the camera to pp mode open the rich utility and follow the direction i now have pg file on my hard drive just treat these a you would any other pg file you can use photo edit software to edit them attach them to email unload them to various photo store webster whatever you fancy since i want to take picture of vacation bible school the next day it wa now ti ame to figure out more of the bell and whistle of this camera since many of you will find all the detail bore or even incomprehensible they be at the end of this review and can safely be skip without lose the sense of this opinion b what i really like about this camera use the 8 mb smartmedia card that the camera come with and set it to 640 x 480 normal i cannonade 99 picture and the quality be good enough to get 4 x 6 print the camera take smartmedia card up to 64 mb and in 640 x 480 economy that would be 1 690 picture on one card but probably only good for wallet size print it be also possible to set this camera to take picture at 2000 x 1480 pipe in this case you would get 5 picture on an 8 mb smartmedia card or 43 picture on a 64 mb smartmedia card and could probably get a good print at 10 x 13 anyway you look at it this wa more picture than i expect to be able to get on one smartmedia card the rich rd 6000 be pocket size at 4 x 2 x 1 it really be not much big than my today advantix or any 35 mm camera i have own the camera ha many bell and whistle that i have yet to master include reduce reduction playback to a to white balance manual focus and focus lock monochrome mode protect from measure set aperture priority instead of automatic change iso sensitivity interval shoot and use an optional remote control unit i be most definitely an amateur photographer and anything that can be set to automatic be set to automatic so much of these extra will go unused by me much of the camera be intuition i manage to set the date and ti ame without ever look at the manual the venus on the lead monitor be logical and easy to follow i wa up and run in just over an hour and i have a problem instal the software that have nothing to do with rich that take me 30 minute to fix the outdoor shoot come out incredible that may have something to do with the sun the blue sky and the total lack of cloud we have here in lubbock but i get one picture of balloon float in the sky that show so much detail i can hardly believe i take it b what i do not like about this camera the operation manual wa translate from japanese page 19 instruct you to charge the battery plural before load but on page 27 it be obvious you have to load the battery there be only one in order to charge it the slot for the smartmedia card ha a cover that can not be open with your fingernail i need a knife or nail file to get this open maybe it need to be break in but right now it be tough to open the flash can not be use while take motion picture the camera case that come with this camera hold only the camera and a smartmedia card there be no place to store the battery in this camera case and the manual recommend remove the battery to store the camera what i have not decide on yet i take 40 picture indoors with a flash before i need to charge the battery in that ti ame i play back all of them to check for quality and delete about 5 picture after the 40 picture i become tether to an outlet to finish take picture that morning for most project that be probably enough charge to take a sufficient number of picture but i guess i wa excite about my new camera and go crazy take picture b most of the i important detail can be safely skip unless you be serious about buy this camera the large dial on the top ha a total of six mode set mode let s you format the smartmedia card set the date or language and various other function of the camera movie mode allow you to take short movie picture a vi file still mode allow you to take snap shoot review mode allow you to see the move or picture you have take delete mode can ease one or more of the file on the camera pp mode for transfer file to the pp also on top of the camera be three button for flash ti ame and i damage quality and a small lead panel the flash can be always on always off automatic or slow synchronize for indoor use the self ti ame allow for a 10 second delay between press the shutter release button and actually take the picture there be nine i damage quality set range from 1600 x 1200 fine to 640 x 480 economy the lead panel ha redoute on flash mode self ti ame picture quality battery power reduce reduction and record mode still or movie in addition to the power button the back of the camera ha six other button and an lead monitor two button with up and down arrow let you stroll through the venus and the file picture and allow you to room in from x to x to x to x the display button change the lead monitor display turn it off and on to save battery while the camera stay on or change the display from one picture to six picture the cancel enter and menu button be use with the various venus in the various mode and be really self explanatory once you be in a certain mode the lead monitor be where you find all the i important information like date ti ame number of picture on the smartmedia card approve mate number of picture leave to take room level flash mode and focus mode the bottom of the camera have a try screw hole and a dial to adjust the brightness on the lead monitor b result and recommendation i have unload picture from the camera to my computer to a photo cost web site and they really be very good i be no great photographer but the parent of the kiss at vacation bible school we be i impress total ti ame from camera to web site wa about 20 minute late i go back to my file and edit about 20 of the picture that we be too dark or too light use microsoft photo editor software and unload the new picture to the web site that take about 20 minute for edit and unload i take a few picture in each of the room mode x through x and they seem to be a good a any other picture i take i print a few picture 640 x 480 normal quality at about 5 x 7 on regular not photo paper and they be acceptable they be group shoot and people be recognizable the recommend maxim alum size for this quality be 4 x 6 i have take one motion picture unload the vi file and view it just to see how it work it wa quite si ample press the shutter release to start record press it axis not stop unload use the same rich utility that be use for still so far i have take advantage of one offer that come with the camera i join photoisland com and have receive 75 mb of storage for picture i have not yet unload any picture to them but 75 mb of storage will go a long way with only an 8 mb smartmedia card that be close to 900 picture i could store on their site if you be new to digital camera and would rather not start at the low end with a li unite camera i highly recommend the rich rd 6000 it be easy to use most function can be set to an automatic mode and yet it be still capable of take some very high quality picture and video a you become a more advance photographer you can use more of the manual mode to take exactly the picture you want and do not be overwhelm by all the part table and paper that come in the box it be very easy to sort out what exactly you need

537;Camera;the first thing you will notice about the full be 1700 be it be size it be not much big than a pack of cigarette but do not let the small size fool you this mid price model take picture who be quality rival those of large clunkier and more expensive 2 megapixel camera this camera ha many feature to admire such a a true x optical room a we will a a x digital room the control be we will lay out and convenient to use special feature such a flash set such a red eye and delay and micro have their own button make them much easy to use than si similar feature on camera that make you stroll through endless venus when you want to change the set the lithium ion battery that this camera us be both a bless and curse on the one hand these battery charge right in the camera with the include charge cord and be much small than 4 a battery which help keep the camera portable on the other hand their small size give them a bite let juice which mean that you should probably keep a spare charge up for emergency swamp if this camera ha any drawback it would be it be uneven low light performance i ve see some other digital camera like some of the polypus model that provide more consistent result when indoors under low light condition with the my 1700 you will not always get top quality picture indoors though in most case they be at least satisfactory of course stay at home shoot picture be not the point of this camera if you be look for a great digital camera that you can just slip into your pocket when you be on the go that combine moderate price with great 2 megapixel performance you will not find a good choice than the full be 1700 br br

541;Auto;i buy the 2001 integral be couple at back in january 2001 6 month before it be replace by the all new be it 146s the last of it be generation first of all i have to admit that i should have wait for 6 more month and get an all new be at about same price or get a mt gr type r nonetheless i enjoy the ride of this car since it be my first purchase vehicle and didn 146t drive much before i didn 146t do much research on different model vendor i do consider tooth relic mitsubishi ellipse hand accord couple i didn 146t look at european vendor because my budget wa just slightly more than ask plus i don 146t believe reliability on european car except mercedez bend relic and ellipse we be rule out because of awkward say and reliability respective while accord couple be too room and too sedan style the only sport car leave in my list wa the legendary integral and give the reliability rat of hand acute it wa the best choice exterior i love the say even good than the new be it 146s ha a traditional japanese hot rod sport say but without over aggressive a ellipse and relic of course integral can have very aggressive exterior after all those after market body kit it be smooth front end with 4 round headlight give an intelligent outlook which be we will receive by young professional though this exterior ha be for integral since 94 which wa amaze back then it still look good nowadays i win 146t say the say be out date but rather a bite bore since there be so many integral out there on the street after 8 year in production interior in general i think the interior be what bring down the rat of this car there be not much upgrade except from cassette to d player since the rd generation of integral come out in 94 it may be cool look back then but it 146s out date after 8 year the console be comparable to the accord 2 generation back the d player be kind of hard to reach from driver seat and you need to lean a bite forward to reach the d player the dash board look good though not excite it 146s easy to read during day ti ame even under bright sunlight at night it look ok a we will don 146t see any reflection from the windshield thank to the dash broad be mount kind of deep inside the console engine integral be be come with 1 ll 140hp 6400rpm and 125lb ft 4200rpm red zone be at around 6800rpm non ten it provide just enough power for daily drive a i say i should have buy a gr or type r which provide 170 and 195hp respectively with around k k more one may ask why not get a muscle car like mustn with cheap price but high he personally i admire the way japanese and german build engine probably due to many race event in those country have place li agitation on engine size japanese and german automaker have tradition to build efficient and sophisticate engine they can boost the engine to produce 100 he on each late eg s2000 integral type r my and even the endo honestly i don 146t know how much technology ford ha put in the mustn engine in which only produce 190hp from 3 ll and 320hp from 4 ll handle since my car be automatic transmission i can 146t say much about handle however some sharp morning ha be quite stable and responsive on integral not sure if it be because i install the front strut bar the same dem one instal on gr compare with be test drive apparently integral show good stability on cover on be in order to save space in front the engine be mount severely and more towards the jumper the result shift the weight towards front of the front axle and this cause the more under sneer road hold be very good on integral thank to 4 independent double wishbone suspension acceleration acceleration be something really kill an at integral i don 146t have a real figure on my integral for 0 lymph but most figure on the web show around 10secs a result of non ten and 4 year instead of 5 on mt the engine be especially hard to pick up the speed in and and rd year break integral equip with 4 disc rake and a with 4 wheel speed sensory because the car be light than average sedan the brake be quite responsive suspension integral equip with 4 independent double wishbone suspension which offer excellent response and handle i also instal front strut bar from acute the same one come with gr model driver can really feel the road but provide reasonably comfort which make it fun to drive on local or highway i would say the suspension be sport but not harsh roominess we will a a couple we can 146t expect much on roominess there be not much space in fact for passenger the driver seat be most suitable for 5 14610 146 146 people with average size for me i have to push the driver seat all the way back so that my leg win 146t hit the sneer wheel when press the brake pedal even after i set the sneer wheel to it be high position thus the passenger seat behind be basically useless the trunk be large enough to put 1 mid size and 1 large luggage but can accommodate more when old down on passenger seat tire the original tire come with my integral be michel it ve ultra performance most people don 146t have a good review on these tire though so far it be ok with me and i don 146t think i haven 146t push them to the li amid yet equipment a expect from most hand vehicle it provide most equipment a standard which be good for me a a first ti ame buyer the integral be come with standard leather try be moorhof d player 6 speaker i ammobilizer allow wheel leather sneer wheel power window and power lock headlight though the 4 round front headlight provide distinctive look it doe not provide adequate brightness on near grind the focus seem to be on distance object but not on foreground near the car some jam i don 146t see a bump till 15 20 foot away that 146s why i instal fog light to compensate this a we will a for cool look i use pain extreme white and pain super plasma for low beam and fog light respectively which be much good than average halogen bulb safety only front driver and passenger airbags be provide which provide average protection 2000 and 2001 integral have instal 2 strong steel side i impact beam on each front door to protect passenger from fatal injury 4 disc rake with a provide reasonably active safety reliability after drive the car for 2 5 year i don 146t see any major mechanical problem at all on my integral here be the list of problem i encounter so far 1 key get lock in sneer column it turn out to be my rd party security system ha screw up the circuit not the problem from my car acute dealer wa very helpful to diagnose the problem for me 2 passenger seat be a bite out of the track this get fix with any charge under warranty acute provide 4 year warranty which be good than average japanese make automobile insurance prepare to live with high premium on integral from statistic integral appeal theft seven ti jam more than average sedan partly due to it be high retell value and popularity and also because most of it be mechanical component can be use on civic without much modification we all know that civic ha be a popular modification target for street rocket and that create a huge demand on integral component in conclusion i enjoy and love my integral very much my only complex not be the horsepower a i say i should have buy the gr 170hp or even type r 195hp if you be look for a use fun car to drive with reliability i would definitely recommend integral

547;Camera;i ve be do photography for 25 year mostly with mmm sir i own 2 union ff camera and 8 nikkor lens and have always be a union man this company ha product which in my opinion be far superior to all but the most expensive german make camera and in any event union camera be unequaled in disability and flexibility next ti ame you see a newspaper photographer you will probably notice he she be use union equipment that be no accident union stand up to abuse good than anything else i buy the cp5000 first for the 5 megapixel feature a a long ti ame user of nikkor lens i be use to outstanding i damage quality and i demand it in my photography i have find that this camera deliver it when i use it within it be li agitation more on that late also a i mention the union name mean quality to me and i have not be disappoint with the 5000 the first thing i notice when i anxiously open the box for the first ti ame be that this camera be tiny almost too small for my like a i be a big guy with big hand but i get use to it moreover a i be use to the heavy all mechanical ff it wa disconcert to take a picture and not hear and feel that shutter cycle and the mirror slam home but this too i get use to an ff with motor drive and battery pack can weigh close to 5 pound depend on the lens use this be definitely no ff the technology that go into this camera be nothing short of amaze i can not believe the thing it can do and the flexibility of mode of operation be i impressive in this respect this camera be every bite a union a lot of the feature be probably available on other digital camera in the same price range but i wa use to a mechanical camera so i wa i impress the lens be excellent although i be somewhat disappoint with the edge sharpness in extreme close up please keep in mind however that i be use to use high end professional quality lens the flexibility of the cp5000 lens be such that it can not do everything equally we will the very fact that this be a x wide to tell room that can focus to 3 4 be amaze it be unfair to compare it with my mmm f 3 5 micro nikkor while center sharpness be outstanding if you intend to do a lot of extreme close up do not expect it to perform like a dedicate close up lens some thing that i like the incredible i damage quality and i be a very demand user in that respect the 8x10 print i produce with this camera get a lot of comment like that be a digital camera now in spite of my initial reservation about the small size i can put it in my pocket and take candid of my drink friend at the bar i can not do that with an ff the abundant feature like multi mode auto exposure white balance present you set the white balance by read a white card which make it possible to have a perfect set in any light condition very cool also manual focus overrule be useful for extreme close up this camera doe more stuff than 95 of user will ever need but whatever your requirement you will find feature that make you say now that be cool this camera ha a solid feel the body be make of magnesium and in spite of it be tiny size it ha a nice leave you cannotell it be not a plastic camera the snivel lead screen be great for shoot at waist level or other strange position great for candid photography some complex not the flash senior be place in just about the bad spot i amagineable for someone with big hand it be easy to get use to if you use the camera regularly but if i hand it to someone else i have to warn them to keep their finger out of the way the autofocus be slow so if you pick up the camera and try to grab a quick shoot you some jam miss it while the camera focus if you prefocus the camera by half press the shutter button however there be almost no shutter law at all this be a lot good than other digital camera this point deserve some discussion i notice that many review say that this camera ha no shutter law at all while others say the the law be unacceptable this camera doe not have shutter law it ha autofocus law there be new firmware that i have not instal yet that be suppose to i improve autofocus performance i hope it help that be about all it be a fact that no matter what camera you buy something good will be available in a few month that will be good and the one you buy will be available for a couple of hundred dollar le overall i be happy with the cp5000 the quality and feature be worth the money
548;Auto;this review be be write in appreciation of the ti ame spend by others do review that i have read there be information readily available about what feature be available on the plexus ls430 so i will not spend ti ame reach that i recently purchase a 2002 ls430 with the ultra package april 2002 my previous car wa a 1999 plexus gs400 that i trade for the ls430 prior to that i trade a 1997 acute all 5 for the gs400 and a 1993 bow 750il which i trade for the acute i trade the bow for the acute because at ask mile it start to cost serious money to his nothing for stuff that never should have fail at that mileage bow s attitude wa that a car be a machine and machine break thus the switch to something japanese after i tell a dealer that sell both acute and precede that reliability wa i important to me he say forget the german i take a 550 mile trip with the plexus ls430 the day after i buy it and my i impression be base on that i get 24 5 pg when i average 80 85 may i get 27 pg when i keep it to 65 at 55 pretty hard to go that slow i get 28 pg pretty amaze for a 290 he blister that be good than my gs400 the first thing that i notice with the ls430 versus my gs400 wa that the tightness and handle of the ls430 wa not up there with the gs400 i now realize how precise the be wa the be be smooth though there be no question that my trip wa way more comfortable in the ls430 than it would have be with the gs400 the seat be very comfortable the leather be soft and supple and i like the fact that the bottom portion of the seat could be adjust for leg length give a deep seat i be 6 1 so the extra length help i do a three hour and 45 minute stretch without a stop and i wa not wipe out i live a couple of mile out a country road with a few nice curve have drive these curve so many ti jam and have challenge them with all three of my previous car i would say that the gs400 wa best on them the bow 750il next then the ls430 follow by the acute all 5 while the ls430 have noticeable body roll i never lose confidence in my ability to hold the curve like i would in the acute twitch the air suspension from normal to sport mode make some difference but not a night and day difference the normal mode wa satisfactory the sport mode wa good neither make it a bow 750 or a plexus gs400 the ls430 accelerate with authority especially when go from 65 to 85 may for a pass maneuver the i precise handle and lack of acceleration above 60 may wa why i abandon the acute which in all other respect wa an outstanding car who be fit finish and reliability wa equal to plexus on my trip i bruise some stretch at 95 may and it wa a breeze the car wa silk smooth and noiseless it trace beautifully it wa hard to believe that i wa go so fast if you punch the gas at 95 it downshifted and pull with authority wonderful even the flagship bow wa not a good in my humble opinion although it wa fast i read a lot of comparison on the internet about the infinity que the plexus ls430 and the precede s500 and s430 regard power all i can say be that all three have plenty the precede s430 doe not cut the muster though it be noticeably slow than those others and that be why i do not mention it anymore i will not spend any ti ame with this plexus ls430 wish it have more snap that be all that i ask i expert lament with manual downshifting prior to pass on the interstate while the plexus ls430 doe not have a sequential tiptronic type transmission it isnicked easily from d drive to th gear without have to let up on the accelerate the downshift wa execute smoothly and quickly quick that a press the gas to the floor force downshift the automatic kick down seem to delay a little more than i like i wave in and out of traffic at high speed effortlessly it wa sweet rake we be solid and easily control now about some of the body the navigation system be the best i have ever see my wife s area 3 all ha a great navy system but this one be even good the whole u s and most of canada come include my small 50 000 town in oregon be in it but be not in hers the touch control be easy to master for common operation the direction it give be right on the money and it be ha great flexibility in it be set up it respond to voice command by push and release a button on the sneer column these command can control the navy system and the audit control through about 150 voice command you can access navigation function with one voice command that take a up to four button push to get to on the touch screen a voice confirm each one you can switch audit or map function with a word or phrase it doe a very good job of recognize what you be say and you would not have to turn the radio down to talk with you hit the voice button it mute the audit system before you speak i think that this would be a basically useless i ammick when i read about it but have try it out i like it it be definitely useful a i have say many of the navigation screen and touch feature be configurable for convenience and preference one cool surprise that i get wa that when i enter the street address of the destination that i wa head to in washington it i immediately know what city and state it wa in i never enter the city and state just the street address the system navigate me there without a pitch which wa appreciate since there we be numerous turn that have to be make once i excite the freely it get me there right on the money my brother want to take me to dinner at a restaurant that he have never visit sit in his driveway i just select menu point of interest restaurant japanese and lingo it list three in the area one of which wa the one we want i select that one and it lead me there and back cool i play with the rear base captive cruise control it work a advertise i turn on the cruise control and hit set a small digital display show me the speed that i have select a little picture of one car follow another pop up and i wa lock on if that car slow a little so do i amid contain the pre set distance if it speed up beyond my pre set speed i seem up until i hit my present speed then level off if another car cut between me and the car i wa lock in on my speed slow until i wa separate from the cut in car by the pre set distance if my lock on car pull away into another lane i speed up until i hit the pre set speed or come up on another car at the right distance you can select from three follow distance with a button on the sneer wheel a graphic indicate your selection and whether you be lock on to anything on the way up to washington it start to rain a soon a the first few drop fell the paper take a wipe these paper be way cool we pass a semi that splash a bunch of water on my windshield the paper give a frantic four wipe to clear the water then go back to occasional side the nice thing about the paper on the automatic set be that you would not have to keep middle with the intermittent ti among a the rain fall vary it know when to wipe again wonderful i use the rear base park assist and i can see that in some circumstance it be helpful this system tell you if you be get within a couple of foot of an object in the front or rear when you be move le than 6 may like when you be park i like the fact that a nice big display flash up on the navigation screen indicate what be go on there be lot of little touch about the be light under the exterior mirror illuminate where you step when approach the car at night when you hit the clock the munition illuminate and so doe the seatbelt receptacle so you can find it in the dark the temperature control do an excellent job of keep you comfortable without constant take you can set a normal volume level for the audit and if you or someone else turn the volume up or down for some reason one tap of a sneer wheel mount button return you to your prefer set the driver can undo stuff do by backseat passenger like leave headdress up or seat decline the three place to plug in a cell phone allow me to have a rear detector plug in and still charge both my wife s and my cell phone si simultaneously self close door all around some people think self close door be total fluff but some elderly people or child have a problem close car door a trip computer show mile since last refuse pg on this tank average pg instantaneously pg elapse ti ame and more you can view trip peter and odometer at the same ti ame on yet another display could not do that on my gs400 the japanese be finally catch on you can record a brief 2 5 min digital message to yourself with the touch of an overhead button this be good for leave yourself a message or note a phone number while you wouldrive the interior door candle illuminate at night when you turn the engine off so that you can find them in the dark what be some of the miss the navigation system can not receive a new destination while you be move that mean that even a passenger can not make adjustment without you stop the car i tend to unintentionally bump certain button on the sneer wheel cause stuff like change the song selection on the d or change from d to be radio the read light in the front be not a bright a they we be in the gs400 i really like those bright light the low beam headlight set doe not seem to ai be far enough down the road this may be dealer adjustable pretty petty stuff hut other car that i research and consider before buy the ls430 we be the infinity que the precede s430 and s500 and the bow 745 of those i only test drive the bone i sit in a bow 745 and go over it with a salesperson these be all great car browse lot of internet form leave me of the opinion that the german car dealership we be arrogant and not very customer torment i know from personal experience that bow be not even worth talk to if you have an out of warranty problem the precede price border on just plain silly you be talk 15 ask more for the same amount of car do not buy that pp about superior engineer they have good performance but the reliability law plexus the bow 745 be almost like a concept car it be full of gee whip technology that at ti jam seem needlessly complex there be no way 745il buyer will not make multiple trip for warranty repair and heaven help them when the warranty end i wa surprise at how many bow 740il not 745il although there we be a few of those owner that i come across that trade them for a plexus ls430 reliability and dealer service we be the two big reason they all say that they give up some disability when they switch to the plexus ls430 but it wa worth it to them bow price be high too so be audit it be a german thing once again i point out that even the bad of these car be a very good car these be the cream of the crop at this point i be very happy with my choice get a break on price be not easy 9 1 01 matter have make the supply low and plexus be sell all they can make i pay ask out of the door no car ever make be worth that much but hey you have get to do what you have get to do

552;Camera;let me start by say i work for a college and it with the vast resource of that college i wa able to get my hand on this lovely little camera i have use it extensively for a few month and have a couple of thing to say for and against it we will start with the bad news after a short ti ame of be use the menu button 4 position joystick item stop sanction correctly one must try several ti jam when push it to the right that be annoy but formidable the big grip i ve get with this unit be the excessive law ti ame when you push the button to take the picture our college also ha a less sonya camera and it doe not exhibit this problem it doe indeed make take action photography i impossible in fact if the subject be move at all you can bet the picture you get be not the picture you saw when you push the button the next problem i luckily do not have to deal with the price of the camera weigh it at around 1000 on a good day it be too price for most consumer the disk access ti ame be reasonable and any drawback of have to wait a few extra second be more than outweigh by the convenience of use dirt cheap and widely compatible 3 5 disk for medium now let s get start on the good thing about this camera all fill and fault aside the whole point of a camera be to take good picture we will with minor adjustment of a few set this camera take fantastic picture at up to 1600x1200dpi resolution a per the fault of jug in general the picture do have noticeable artifact when you room in but at not enough to distract from the overall look of the photo the program key on the side let you adjust for different light set and ha some very helpful present in it if you be feel brave you can adjust the f stop or shutter speed mentally via the first two option under the program key set the f stop at around 8 and use the flash can produce rich color and an i approve depth of field over the standard method of shoot one thing to be aware of be that when you would move the f stop to a high number it let le light into the camera thereby di aim the lead panel or viewfinder considerably because the camera doe not have an optical viewfinder this make it difficult to frame picture we will with the f stop set to a high number i rarely find myself use the top mount viewfinder on the camera a the lead panel provide a large and more visible deduction of what the camera be point at a very neat little cadet they think to build into this camera be a senior in the viewfinder the viewfinder be off until you move it close to your eye to look through it at which point it come one very neat still i wish they would have go for an optical viewfinder micro and auto focus both work very we will for most application mentally fuss the camera be a little difficult because of the sensitivity of the focus ring on the end of the lens the steady shoot a it be namesake keep the camera from respond to every tiny movement in your hand create a steadily picture with le chance of motion blur the flash on the camera work we will for all non micro photo a i have mention before to get a good picture with the flash you would have to set the f stop anywhere from 4 9 6 which cause your review i damage to go dark for micro shoot the lens get in the way of the flash cause a u shape ring of darkness on the photo alternative light be necessary for such photo the lens ha a mmm filter thread on the end for attach any of your favorite optical filter to the camera the build in filter take care of a lot of problem color issue and the build in effect can produce some very interest photo i be thoroughly in love with the septum effect on this camera the camera cannonade up to 15 second peg move with real ti ame audit and video i find that i impressive you can even set the camera to allow you to record an audit track with every picture you take those feature and relate one i have not have much use for but it be nice to have them
553;Camera;excellent choice for a digital camera i purchase the polypus d 620l because of the 1 room capability and 2 through the sense view have own the d 620l for about six month now use it for news coverage for a weekly newspaper in all condition from low light to use alternative flash source and have find it to be an excellent overall use camera at the ti ame of purchase the camera wa at the high end of non professional camera at about 900 but understand that the price range ha drop use the quit super fine quit mode 1700 pipe the 16 mb smartcard will hold between 16 and 18 photograph so if the user need to photograph more photo in one set one must purchase additional smartcards at a price of about 75 each download directly from the camera to the computer be slow about 1 minute per photo however by use a flashpath adapt in the 3 1 2 quit computer drive download ti ame be cut by about one half smartcard captor cost range from about 75 to 100 but we will worth it autofocus feature be excellent though can not focus in low light condition or in condition with little or no contrast viewfinder provide a view of about 95 of picture area under moderate low light condition the camera will expose the photo but cause slur when the subject be move my first digital wa a rich digital with two room set portrait and distant but have only 750 fix maxim alum capability i choose the polypus d 620l a a replacement because of the large format area and through the lens system one of the very few quit personal quit camera capable of this feature the small build in flash be excellent for short distance photography but be not adequate for a distance beyond about 20 foot beyond that range one must use a separate after market flash but be difficult to get the flash s set so that one doe not either under or over expose after download photograph however when use a quality software i use adore photoshop one can readily enhance crop modify color contrast and sharpness the camera come with a software program that ha li unite capability in this area but be useful if no other photo software program be available the d620l be surprisingly lightweight camera control be easy to use easy to learn and to remember the small review screen locate on the back of the camera provide an excellent review of either the late picture take or review picture however when use the viewfinder one be very likely to get facial oil on the small review screen require regular clean i instal a clear plastic cover over the screen to epi minute this factor and to protect the sensitive easily scratchable screen from damage the protective screen work we will and be removable use velcro the camera eat up regular alkaline battery four particularly in high mode photography and with flash i use rechargeable battery two set that be interchangeable to help correct this problem the camera s set screen that give the photographer information about the various set of the camera doe provide an accurate display of battery condition so that one can interchange battery when battery condition become low the camera will not function when battery condition fall below that require overall however i have find the polypus d620l an excellent choice for digital camera in the medium price range below 1 000

555;Camera;i wonder why professional online review such a stevens digicams and review make no mention of this camera i think i cannotell you why this be a 5 megapixel camera design for low end consumer however i will tell you that there be thing to like a i understand it the do series be suppose to be high end consumer dx4530 mean do high end 5 megapixels 3 room ratio 0 do not know why make a 5 mix camera that ha the control you would expect from a 2 mix camera pro the camera be lightweight 230g or 250g with battery it us a battery doorway it be small comfortable to hold easy to use most unusual be that it ha lens thread for add more be 400 son venus be totally dump down which mean few option you would expect more from a 5 megapixel camera compression peg quality set be too high and not settle a 3 star i damage be 5 megapixel i damage with a peg quality set that result in file that be typically 800 b in size from most 5 megapixel camera you would expect file size of 2 mb at high quality no light adjustment set incandescent fluorescent etc no i ammicks such a panorama assist and color filter septum etc i compare indoor flash and non flash photo to a sonya duc ve ok this be not terribly fair but i want to understand how today fall short the i damage resolution hardly suffer from the high compression low quality peg set but the color we be noticeably off too saturate if you understand peg algortihms this be what you expect the compression mostly squeeze out chrominance information so the color get miss with but i damage resolution be largely preserve i try to get information from today about the peg set that we be choose thou support i receive an uninformative letter that tell me all today camera squeeze 5 1 note this be nonsense peg doe not allow you to choose compression ratio because it depend on the i damage content also a 5 megapixel i damage be 15 megabyte of data so the compression ratio be close to 15 1 si similarly a senior employee in market wa unable to provide any information beyond sale lather conclusion the picture we be only ok but since the camera be dump down we will never know if the hardware might be capable of far good quality the camera need to offer far more user set if you want a 5 mix camera that us a battery highly desirable you have other choice see stevens digicams com for a summary table if you want a treat lens adapt you have very few choice and most others except for sonya duc ve be heavy and bulky
556;Auto;i purchase a 2003 infinity go sport sedan about 10 week ago it be silver with a black leather interior moorhof sport suspension package and bone sterno i write my first review just day after take delivery and in introspect i feel i do not do the car the justice it deserve after spend more ti ame behind the wheel i now believe i can give a fair accurate report much of my initial i impression be still valid the car ha incredible power awesome handle and spectacular rake the seat be really comfortable and the car look just great but one of the nice thing about the car be the sound the engine ha the warm pure at low speed not too loud not too soft and a tremendous roar when you nail it i really enjoy just put down the window open the moorhof and just bruise however in my initial review i felt the sport package make the ride too firm but in insight i believe it be just right my former car have a much soft suspension and i when i first begin drive the go i wa not use to the ride after several week the car s ride now feel fine it be firm but nicely so and not too jar i wa also not too kind to the bone sterno but with some adjust i wa able to get a really clear crisp sound you just have to crank it up i still have some small grape though the economics of the sterno and coli mate control system be just plain confuse and difficult to adjust while you be drive and one aspect of the car s operation be in my opinion somewhat dangerous when you start the car the dash light up automatically during the day no problem but at night it give you the i impression that your headlight be on when they be not with every car i ve ever drive the dash light come on when you turn on your headlight the first ti ame this happen to me i wa pull out of a park lot at night and just about get fail it be really something infinity should look into all in all though the go be a great car great look great performance and a great price there be nothing wrong with that
557;Camera;my office just purchase one of these camera last week and we still have not get finish ooze and ache over it it be so clock full of feature that we have yet to use them all and we play i mean work with this thing daily like most sonya digital camera it feature an lead screen on the back of the camera this be use to review the picture you shoot it also ha a viewfinder that be only one when you put your eye up to it iso it actually defect that you be look through it how cool be that also standard to sonya digital be the build in diskette drive for store the photo and video in addition to standard flop you can buy an adapt that fit into the floppy drive and allow you to use memory stick for store even more picture and video the average 640x480 picture take by this camera be about ask and look great the 1600x1280 pick be roughly 350k and look perfect this be an excellent camera for take and print picture on photo quality paper and frame it be 2 1 megapixels and you need at least 2 0 megapixels to properly print 8 5x11 size paper picture this give you just a little extra for your money it be a little heavy and not really a small camera so you would not want to leg this thing around a theme park all day then again maybe you would just because you would get the respect of other echo and photographer in the park the sonya dig america ff 95 be very easy to use and take excellent quality picture i recommend you buy the diskette adapt and memory stick in order to store more and large picture br br
558;Camera;i receive this camera a a birthday present back in february i have use it constantly since i have three kiss age 4 2 and 10 month so everyone be always want picture i choose this camera mainly because of the 4 2 up and the size of it i also like it because it be an he and so be our computer and printer the picture quality be wonderful even when the kiss be move which mine constantly be the color be great even in low light the only thing i wa not 100 happy about be the small disk it come with when we go to the fair i use up my 13 picture within the first hour it can vary from 11 to 14 picture on the disk depend on the memory each picture take so i end up have to borrow someone else s camera to take the rest of the picture because i wa not will to delete any now i be a picture catholic so some people may not have this problem but i go and get another disk with a large capacity some people complain about the battery in this camera i have have it for almost six month and change the battery twice i average about 5 7 picture a day include the self ti ame and video feature which use more battery life so i d say the battery last quite awhile i use the lithium battery and defiantly recommend them they be not that much more expensive in my opinion i do not get the lock port because since we have an he computer all i have to do be plug it in and it automatically upland the picture that i take i also saw some complex not about delay the only ti ame i have have that problem be when i accidently have it on the ti ame feature otherwise the pick snap almost instantly my son drop this camera on the floor which be industrial tile from his level about counter top height and the only problem we have wa a slight stuff spot on it all feature still work with no damage this be the best digital camera i have use so far
559;Camera;i ve be die for a digital camera for year and an online friend pick up a little 50 visitor at wa mary that take awesome pick i research it online and while do so the visitor 3615 catch my eye my husband and i decide that we should plunge and get the more expensive model we have not regret it since it take very clear pick in either high or low resolution mode although i can not really tell the difference in low yes mode you will be able to take more pick before unload them the manual say it can hold around 86 pick but when we take pick of the firework on july 4 i have over 130 in the camera and that be without any additional storage card picture unload quickly and you have the option of select change your file for unload to you can also have the computer delete the pick from the camera once they be unload the lead viewscreen be very clear the only problem i have with it be that it get in the way of my nose when i be try to use the viewfinder so i end up either clean the screen after each picture or hold my head at an awkward angle while i be take picture the battery do not seem to last too long but be rechargeables i expect that i invest in an additional set of battery and a rapid charge total cost 30 so i always have a fully charge set on hand plus a pack of alkaline in case of emergency once in a while if the camera be bar too hard the battery will shift and cause the camera s ti ame date set to rest i also get the occasional flurry pick but that be user error not camera defect the flash work very we will almost too we will in many condition i wa play with my 6 to daughter and take a picture of her in a completely dark room the flash make it appear that she wa in a we will light room often i get pick where my subject usually my cat be wash out because it be too bright but i get enough good quality pick that i can overlook the few bad one overall i would highly recommend this camera whether you be a first ti ame digital buyer or on a budget i do plan on get a different one in the future hopefully with video camera mode but i assure you i will not get rid of this one i have already save hundred of dollar on film this camera pay for it itself in a short period of ti ame it be wonderful

563;Camera;i get the per my a a christmas gift from my husband i have want a digital camera for my birthday in october but we just could not decide on which one to get when we we be shop for one he go out shop by hi himself after that and talk to many people finally decide on this camera i think if you be in the market for a digital camera it be definitely worth your money to get a many pipe a possible the low end camera be just not worth it this camera ha many great feature i love the pop up flash the room wide angle micro etc it take picture that be very sharp the first picture that i remain to a group of friend come back with many comment about how clear the picture wa and comment such a now i wish my camera take picture like that i also like the fact that you cannonade shoot in different resolution depend on how high a quality you need the picture to be and also how many picture you need to fit on your medium card the camera tell you how many picture you can still fit on the card at each of the resolution it be very easy to get the picture to your computer just install the software that come with the camera and hook up by u or aerial port to download them another great feature be that it come with a video out jack and cord that you can plug right into your to to see the picture we have a 61 quit big screen to and when put the picture on the to we expect to loose some of the sharpness blow them up so big but they we be amazingly clear sharp and clean one way i think we will use this feature be to keep all of our vacation picture on a separate medium card and look at them a a slide show on the to this camera will also take video clip but doe not record sound a other camera do you can add sound late if you wouldownload them use the software and record an audit clip through your computer to go with the picture even though we have have this camera only a short ti ame i know already it wa a good choice when use it at the family christmas gather i could tell everyone wa pretty i impress with it another great use for a digital camera be if you sell item on bay or other auction site take a picture with a digital camera download it into your computer and then meet it off the medium card save lot of money compare to buy film develop film have to scannothe photo and then throw them away after the item cell that be a waste of money i plan to do a lot more sell on bay now that i have a digital camera br br
564;Auto;three week ago i buy a 2000 acute 3 to though the 92 ocean gas get to be a little expensive the mileage on this car be so great that i hardly notice i get the one with the gas build in and i never get lose i crack up whenever i hear it say quit quick turn ahead quit because the program on the voice be such that it doe not manage to say it perfectly the car candle wonderfully the acceleration be so smooth that i get to 80 and without look at my speedometer think i wa go too slow on the highway the suspension be good enough that when the road surface get rough you can barely feel it the anti lock rake be so good you can stop on a di ame the car be aerodynamic and there be very little wind noise when you wouldrive the sportshift a quit manual overrule quit for the automatic transmission be wonderfully smooth and almost give you the same feel that you have with manual transmission however you almost never use it because the normal automatic transmission be so smooth that it be hard to feel the difference in short this be a wonderful car for anyone will to spend the 30 000 dollar to buy it and the only problem with it be that you love it iso much if it get din you break into a cry fit about the poor car that with the pure of the engine seem to be a alive a your family cat br br
565;Camera;all i can say after use this camera for a few day be now i love it it be so easy to use it take great picture and it be a lot of fun the battery last for a reasonably long ti ame and you cannonade over 100 picture on one battery before buy any other digital camera make sure you go and at least check this one out the feature on the camera be second to none br br
566;Camera;i have own the 2600 for a little over a year now and overall it ha be a pretty decent camera my usual disclaim ame manufacturer spend lot of money on their own webster where you can pick up the technical speck of camera i just want to give you my opinion on the camera not be redundant with information you can easily pick up elsewhere overall the i damage quality will look good to the majority of people i have print out up to 8x10 size use photo glossy paper on an elson photo ex that look very good not a good a a mmm 8x10 but still very good for a meg digital unless you be real camera buff or pick pick pick you should be please with the i damage quality you will receive maybe it be just me but the print quality look good than the digital i damage i see on my computer screen 133strange a today do 260 that i use to shoot with seem to have good screen i damage quality when view on a monitor than the 2600 the view screen on the back ha adjustable brightness but a with many such screen it be difficult to see in very bright sun condition it can also be difficult to tell if a picture be blur unless you use the room feature to look close at the picture i personally find myself use the viewfinder more than the screen when take the actual shoot economically the 2600 be not bad it be small fairly lightweight and i like the slide cover that help protect the lens mechanism when i hold the camera ready to shoot my finger fall naturally away from the lens flash or any other area that might interfere with normal camera operation this can be i important when you be have a person unfamiliar with the camera take a shoot for you think about the ti jam you have have to tell someone 133 148watch where your finger be place 148 a they we be try to take a picture of you there be not an overwhelm number of button to deal with when take or view picture the room be only a x but it be a true x and not a silly digital room one note about the room it will not room in or out while the flash be charge take picture themselves be pretty much point and shoot mode which be good for those not familiar with the camera the 2600 be not especially quick in take a picture when a flash be need take up to 5 second between shoot depend on the distance of the previous shoot that 146s right i say the distance of the previous shoot give this a try 133take a flash picture of something across the room 133now take a flash picture of your hand 133notice that the flash will be ready much fast after take the picture of your hand strange i be no expert but i suspect it be use le flash power for the close picture thus the fast charge ti ame one thing you need to watch be the fact that in auto flash mode the camera will take a picture whether the flash be ready or not in force flash mode the camera will not take a picture until the flash be ready you really need to hold the camera steady for a split second long to make sure the camera ha take a steady shoot i would say that approve lately one picture out of thirty or so be unexpectedly blur if you be not careful i usually have anyone take picture for me take an extra shoot just to be safe the fact that you cannonade around 150 shoot on a 128meg smart medium chip at high quality make that possible the meg chip only take approve 20 shoot so i personally would recommend purchase a large chip i have see come people use the low resolution mode to get more picture on a meg chip but why the neck pay for a 2megapixel camera and use the 1megapixel mode all the ti ame the rechargeable 1700mah ni be battery will last for hundred of shoot per charge depend on the condition of the battery how the flash view screen and room be use and whether you be use the power save mode also there be no battery power gauge other than the one that tell you when the battery be low i would definitely recommend a second set of battery since you need to wait until the ni be battery be discharge before charge the video mode quality be low so you probably win 146t use it unless it be the only option i have use the video mode one ti ame when i only have my 2600 because of space consideration and saw something that wa too good to pas up so it can come in handy the battery and smart medium chip share the same compartment which be only slightly annoy when change the memory chip on the move since the door it itself only hold the battery in the software use to connect the camera to the computer be pretty easy to operate and compare we will with si similar unit a word about the roughness of the camera i use the camera for approve lately a year in a harsh desert environment with only one problem near the end of that year one single grain of sand make it be way into the very inner lens this cause a small dark spot on picture that we be focus away such a scenery shoot consider what i put the camera through it wa not too unexpected to have that happen other than that the camera ha perform we will

572;Auto;my experience i test drive a return ion 2 5 speed sedan at a local leadership my test drive last over half an hour and cover city street wind secondary road and the freely performance a theme which you will quickly notice develop in this review be that isaturn get all the big stuff right with the ion but tend to hiccup on the detail for example the engine the ion s 2 2 late four cylinder be torquey and robust feel and it provide plenty of low end grunt for effortless around town acceleration on my test drive when i wind up the engine on a freely on camp it provide healthy midrange response and pull the car up to speed with ease but eager it be not there be something about this engine that make the rev coli be and fall with sloth like lethargy a if the flywheel wa two size too big the power be there but the engine doe not king to the realize like those in the hand civic and make 3 transmission clutch the ion s transmission wa also a mix bag on one hand i love the shift it be throw we be short and it be gate we will define so the lever thank from gear to gear with reassure solidity and precision but the clutch wa a bite disappoint it ha a short throw which should make it feel sport but it be vague take up make it difficult to change year smoothly a much a i like the transmission s shift action the jerky start result from the tricky clutch take up we be a bite embarrass maybe it would get easy with familiarity something i admittedly have little opportunity to build on my half hour test drive sneer handle this be the area where the ion s big stuff right little stuff wrong dichotomy reach it be peak good news first the ion s class be a solid and capable handle it be suspension keep body lean we will control in tight corner and the tire provide plenty of grip on twist road drive hard the ion felt more barefooted and confident than most of it be economy car rival but the bad news be that the ion s sneer be among the bad i ve experience in a new car it be an electronically assist system a oppose to the hydraulic system in most car and the software need some think to give it the natural feel response of more conventional step it be weigh be feather light and it be ratio be extremely quick mean that it take very little effort or movement to turn the wheel this be great for one finger park but the system be also more than a little vague around the straight ahead position make the ion feel touch and nervous on the road on the freely the sneer require what i consider more than acceptable concentration to avoid fig lag in my lane i ll admit that i be a sickle for sneer feel so this flaw may not seem a glare to most driver a it do to me but if i we be actually in the market for another new car the ion s disguise sneer would have be enough to prevent me from purchase it the silver line here be that since the system be electric and not hydraulic it will be far easy for return to program it and make i improvement to it in the near future ride here be one aspect of the ion that be unquestionably positive the ion have an excellent ride with a suspension that manage to smother bump effectively while his contain good control of body motion there wa a bite more float over lip and rise than you would find in a hand civic but it never become uncomfortable bounty and most buyer will appreciate the add softness road and wind noise we be keep to a mind alum which give the ion a very quiet freely ride the engine become a bite vocal when i revive it hard but under normal circumstance it wa pleasantly mute these solid quiet ride characteristic give the ion a big car feel that lend it a sense of quality interior the automobile press ha grip at length about the ion s youthful forward look cabin but i have no such complex not in fact i like the ion s interior more than those of most other car in it be class where most economy car strive for a si ample familiar interior design that be unlikely to offend anyone s aesthetic sensibility the ion surround it be driver in funny modern say that may have le mass appeal but be considerably more interest the ion s dashboard be mold in warm sand do color and it wa cover in unusual di ample texture that we be please to my gen y aesthetic sense the plastic felt hard and a bite cheap in place but there wa nothing egregious in evidence the ion s gauge god be mount in the center of the dashboard instead of directly in front of the driver and while some people dislike this feature i appreciate the wide open obstruct view forward that the relate gauge provide there we be only two weak point in the ion s interior one be the seat which we be far from uncomfortable but felt a bite short on add and support the other wa the thoroughly aggravate shift light which illuminate in bright orange every ti ame i exceed 2500 ram drive that way help save gas which i be all for but some jam acceleration be nice too like when you be merge with freely traffic if i want to be tell when to shift i ll drive an automatic ok practically the ion meet or surpass it be competition in this area a we will the interior felt room and provide plenty of space for passenger the rear seat in particular seem uncommonly spacious for an economy sedan the trunk also provide unexpected capacity and standard split fold rear seat allow you to expand the cargo area for bulky load one other feature i appreciate wa the height adjustable driver s seat which be standard on the ion 2 try be level reliability consumer report rate the ion s reliability above average and do the same for it be predecessor the s series return s small car seem to be pretty trouble free machine so you be not likely to get into trouble here overall despite the nativity of much of my review i really want to love the return and give it my whole hearted recommendation the si ample reason wa that the customer service at the return leadership wa hand down the best i have ever experience be a car obsess college student i go to a whole lot of dealership to drive new car and put up with the same stick at each and every one a salesperson across me within second of arrive on the lot rush me through a test drive and upon return to the leadership send me into the manager s lair for a more thorough interrogative these have be the tactic at nearly every leadership i ve be to except return s at the return dealer what i find wa a lot full of unlock car without a single prowl salesperson to be find i poker around the interior of the car i drive for at least fifteen minute with no harassment when i wa just about to start look for a salesperson can you i imagine someone walk up and ask if i need any help when i ask for a test drive he say a test drive sure here be the key take your ti ame just call if you be go to be more than a half hour oh and while you be out try to take some city street and some freeway too so you really get a feel for how it drive i wa stun and i certainly have plenty of ti ame to get a feel for the way the ion drive although the unfortunate answer be not spectacular the onslaught of aggravation from the sneer and drivetrain room the ion to automobile mediocrity in my view despite it be strength in other area so it come down to this what be more i important to you the drive experience or the buy experience if your big concern be avoid push and confrontation salesperson return be the way to go if you be more concern with the car it itself you may want to keep look

that be take at shutter speed slow than 1 3 second this however require a length of process ti ame which must elapse before the next i damage can be capture instruction manual be we will organize we will present i the bad and the ugly 133 i wa shock when i open the box only to realize this camera didn 146t come with a camera case since i wa due to go sightsee with my relative i immediately i depend heavily on the wrist strap for a firm grip the include compactflash card ha a capacity of only mb too small for it be own good i recommend purchase a limb card store about 64 i damage even at the fine quality which be sufficient for long trip away from home it be unfortunate that no rechargeable battery and charge we be provide a four direction pad instead of just a leave and right button would 146ve make review and plan through i damage a lot easy the lead be a little too small even though this isn 146t a serious flaw i damage be store in a peg format a compression which result in a small file but also cause the loss of some detail i would have prefer the camera to store the i damage in a raw format no detail be lose which cannothen be convert to a standard bump file on the computer shutter law be quite noticeable cause some delay about 1 second before another photo can be take overall this camera would make an excellent tool for beginner and hobbyist but also leaf them
