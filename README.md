## Repository description
This repository has been used for the subject Machine Learning Techniques 2021-2022.  
Three different projects have been carried out:
1. [*ML_Deliverable1*](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RyTssUdFy5K2BdLaPR4AUEWXkRb9IA5v?usp=sharing): application of **clustering** to a white wines dataset. Some conclusions were extracted from the resulting groups.
2. [*ML_Deliverable2*](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PtZzQIYqh0hqkV8Cn3JgjovLEHglhuQZ?usp=sharing): application of **classification** algorithms to autos and cameras purchase reviews. Text mining techniques were applied.
3. [*ML_Deliverable3*](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1an8tBpR84CUR47Fx4GiRDUDcuU4inlF7?usp=sharing): application of **regression** algorithms to insurance claims. The objective was to predict the ultimate costs.

## Execution
The format is jupyter notebooks, so they can be executed from a local computer using [Python](https://www.python.org/). However, [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is recommended for compatibility and better user experience.
